269,3,Does the job,"Pathetic installation service by samsung. Had to coordinate multiple times and escalate installation request via email, calls and whatsapp then they obliged and sent an engineer to install. Were giving false assurances for installation date and wasted my 3 working days. Now for the tv, picture quality is good and sound quality also good.. tizen software is very awkward to use. Will suggest to use firestick or mi streaming options to use with this tv, else, the inbuilt tizen os is very frustrating to use.
Screen mirroring is very difficult to start and hidden deeply inside ths menu options. Thats why reducing 2 stars."
270,3,Does the job,The TV is OK types. Not that good. I already have a bigger TV of Samsung which is very good. So thought of getting this smart TV. But the app is not up-to the mark. Very slow. I guess other brand would have been better. So review is pls do check the market n then buy.
271,3,Does the job,"Speakers below are not gud , as if it in table the voice doesn't circulate, also the panel.is very thin and not of gud quality ..

The only minus point for this tv I noticed is , the remote is not a smart remote. I thought it was. There is no Google assistant. Typing everything is really annoying. I am very disappointed for not having Google assistant. And the installation guy from Samsung was such stupid guy. He finished everything in 15 minutes and left after taking 200 rupees for petrol charges from me. He didnt even installed properly. I managed everything like creating samsung account, cable connection and all. Over all I can say Tv is good except the remote controller."

512,4,Worth the money,"Go for it

Nice 32 inch tv by our old trusted brand Samsung

Samsung make TV's from CRT edition to now QLED

And then Samsung service any where by their experts was good

On last I want to say if any one want to buy tv remember this points:
*Go for a trusted brand who gave good after sale service because this was a tv not a mobile which we donot change after 2 or 3 years.
*Check ratings from inside like picture, sound, connectivity.
*Check online reviews ,video etc"
513,4,Value-for-money,"Value for money..

Pros:
Picture quality and different picture modes.
Sound quality is beyond expectations.
Have all the necessary apps and you can also download them.
Smooth interface, not too much lag.

Cons:
Casting: sometimes picture/video doesn't show while casting.
Thick besels in 2020.

Overall I would say it's a fantastic product from Samsung. Happy that I didn't buy the cheap Chinese alternatives. Go for it if 32 inch hd ready smart tv is your choice. Loved the product..."

High bandwidth you can watch best picture. But i am dissatisfied with the sound. Although it has 20watt rms speakers, but sound is average. Bluetooth is unavailable in this model. I think in low budget its the best tv to buy."
517,4,Nice product,"Review after 2weeks
Am already using Mi 4a Pro for last one year,
Comparing with Mi 32inch tv

Sound is far better than mi
Fast boot and opening is fast - mi tv is delay in boot and switching, app opening

Do not a have a 3.1 audio out,
Sound quality avagage, expected a bit better sound quality from a smart tv, of Samsung
Can not install outside apps, other than pre-installed apps, as not expected on smart tv,
No smart remote,

Other features Excellent...
Thank you Flipkart & Samsung,"

525,4,Delightful,"Pros: Pricing - It comes at a lower price than even a standard smartphone.
Picture - Picture quality is good. However, square pixels are clearly seen if looked closely.
Sound - In a nutshell, ""Awesome"". Value for money.
Pre-installed apps - It has Hotstar, Netflix, YouTube, etc.and few other similar apps built-in. Just switch on your internet and enjoy.

Cons: Bluetooth - It lacks bluetooth connectivity which I feel is unbelievable.
HD Ready only - Resolution is not that great. But keeping the pricing in view, there's nothing much to complain about.

688,4,Value-for-money,"Reviewing after a week's usage. (Will update the review after some time) I purchased it for 15.5K during Big billion days. Overall, this is a value for money TV at this price point mainly because of the picture and sound quality(Major features required for an average everyday user). However, I will list down the pros and cons.

Pros:
- Display is good and the colors are vibrant.
- Speakers are good enough at this price.
- Stereo speakers at this price and equalizer is available. (Didn't play around with it yet)
- Screen Mirroring is available. It works fine with android devices and apple airplay.
- I like the TV interface and it is clean. (It's is a personal preference.)
- I don't find any slowness or app crash which I have seen with Mi Box and some other android TVs. (This might be my experience)

Cons:
- Not an android TV. It runs on Tizen OS.
- Stand was not shipped along with the TV. We need to rely on the installation team or should buy it ourselves.
- TV remote could have been better."

5. Sound is superb.
6. Call quality is great.
7. Red colour looks superb.

1,5,Great product,"Who all loves older size i.e., 4.7 inch type should definitely go for this. Nothing is better than XR, XS or 11. Best for price and usage."
2,5,Super!,"Great camera for pics and videos
Battery life is good so far with some setting turn of which i never use and when i use i turn those on and i use it in power saving mode all the time so a full day with light gaming of 1hr or more using camera for 1hr or more listening music in my car on youtube and Bluetooth on for couple of hours it gives me full day of battery varing from 4/5 to 6/7 hours sot per day
Performance is top notch plays every game and every task with ease
Very premium phone looks great in red colour small handy phone"
3,5,Classy product,One of Best phone in 2020..Excellent Camera and Performance..battery also good without Games..Thanks u Flipkart Best offer and fastest delivery .
4,5,Simply awesome,"This iPhone SE is the best phone ever you get. Beautifully designed gives a classy look in your palms. Moreover, performance wise it is a benchmark. You will not be disappointed in this budget. My purchase point was its size. If you are looking for the same you won’t be disappointed.

I strongly recommend this phone to people who is more work oriented. Game loves should skip this phone as this is not a game phone.

Best features with stunning looks & performance.

Battery life is very good. You need to manage couple of features in phone and phone works with optimum battery level throughout day.

Go for it even if you’re first time iOS user."
5,4,Wonderful,Mobile is very handy. Packed with good performances and nice camera. This is my first iPhone. Very good experience with Apple. Battery is worst. I am hardly getting 5 hours screen on time. Positive thing is I came to know how many hours I was spending on my mobile. Because of poor battery now I am only using mobile for 4 hours a day.
6,5,Classy product,"This is my second iphone after iphone 4s. I’ve been a long time android user in between. I’ll tell you who this phone is for. Prospective buyers can then decide

1. For photo and video enthusiasts. Very reliable camera. Fast and excellent picture quality. Videos are absolutely stable and professional quality. You would be amazed how many people shoot Youtube videos on an iPhone. The only downside is that the display doesn’t do justice to the photos and videos you have taken. Night photos are also not that great but if you get Neural cam app for 400 bucks its well worth it.

2. Very reliable performance. No lag whatsoever. All major apps work better than android counterparts. Internet connection is also more stable. It functions exactly how a smartphone should be.

3. Its fun when you have more apple devices. I have an iPad and airdrop is an amazing feature

4. For those who don’t want to lug a heavy oversized phone in your pocket and but needs all that high end power in a compact form, this phone is the perfect choice.

5. For those who don’t play heavy games and media consumption is moderate. Isn’t that how life supposed to be? More living and less glued to your phone? This is one of the main reasons I switched to this phone. Reduce your big screen and media consumption addiction.

6. If you are okay with charging every night after a day of moderate usage.

Its just a phone. There are much more important things in your life. Don’t waste too much time on this.

Thank you for reading."
7,4,Love at First Home Touch,"Totally worth the price if:

- you are a iOS fan
- like compact phone
- want to switch from android to iPhone
- you like clicking some good photos (camera is unbeatable)
- you multitask (normal phones get stuck between apps, this will keep you going without a hiatus (lag)
- you like to listen to music (have 2 speakers, one on the front, and another below; when I watch a movie with 4d-5d music, it feels like Dolby atmos)

There a lot a technical advantages too which I dont want to get into (you can visit youtube for technical features)."
8,4,Worth the money,"As always compact and handy ... with good image stability
4K gives amazing experience
Battery capacity is little poor ..
it’s worth buying on this budget..
4/5 my rating"
9,4,Very Good,"If you are going to use apple for first time then you will be amazed. Performance wise this phone is ultra first. Camera is also pretty good, attached images were taken indoor only. Display is also quite good.

The BEST thing about this phone is it’s size. So easy to use this phone singe handedly. Excellent grip. Fits very crisply in pockets.

The worst thing is it’s battery. Doesn’t last long. Better to have a power bank to avoid sudden switch off."
10,5,Brilliant,"People talk about it’s battery backup?? man I’m in love with this handset. So clean, so smooth. Smoother than xr if you’ve used both you’ll understand. Camera better than xr. Battery of xr is better but still I’ll vote for se because of A13 Bionic chip, touch haptics and many more reasons. Its a beast in this segment. Still I want you all to feel this beast in your hand. Sexy as it looks, just a perfect masterpiece."
11,3,Iphone SE Budgeted Phone of 2020?,"I have Purchased The new Iphone SE 2020 on 20th May 2020, So based on my usage for a week I can rate the product as follows

* Pros: 1) Display quality seems to be very good.
2) Camera quality is excellent , takes a very sharp images without any blurriness.
3) Touch sensor works very precisely
4) Durability of the phone is good as the quality of body is made of 6000K aluminum which is one of the most durable aluminum in the mobile-industry
5) Speed of the phone is excellent bcz of the latest ""A13 Bionic Processor,"" which is most advanced processor used in Iphone 11.


Cons: 1) The major disadvantage in using this Phone I found in the Battery, As Apple has given an official statement of having ""13 hrs of video playback on full charged"" is not true as Battery get drained within 4 hrs of usage, so if you are using a phone for longer duration don't go for this phone.

2) Screen Size 4.7"" seems to be very short as per the cost of the phone. It could be at least 5.3"".

3) Iphone SE has an Heating problem, I don't whether this issue is encountered in every Iphone or not, but in my Phone it is there & phone gets heated very badly in sudden. while having on video call , gaming or while charging.

4) Hotspot is taking atleast 8 to 10 min while connecting it to other systems Wifi or laptop Wifi which is another major cons I observed."
12,4,Wonderful,"Keep the battery aside and I don’t see any other reason why you shouldn’t buy it. It’s super fast, has an awesome pair of camera, punchy speaker, good looks, beautiful screen, perfect size and an amazing user experience. Everything about this phone is no nonsense.

Coming to battery, I was aware it was less but I didn’t care because for my casual usage, it easily lasts 24hours. It easily gives an onscreen time of 4 hours per day and if you are using your phone for more than that, you know you have got a bad habit to put off."
13,4,Value-for-money,"Camera is best. Mobile performance is good. 4.7 inch display phone is handy phone. Battery capacity is not good but in this range phone is good . Dual sim phone and one sim slot supported eSim. Better series in iPhone is X ,XS ,XR and 11. Software iOS 14.3 is latest."
14,5,Just wow!,"iPhone SE 2020 Looks premium😍
Battery:-Most of the people think it’s only 1800 mAh battery???? Is it sufficient??🧐
After 8 days of usage ..!
in 100%charge
I have played lots of game especially pubg
3Hrs of pubg with fully charge
6Hrs of Heavy usages also played 1Hrs of pubg
14Hrs with normal usage like .,movie,what app,Fb,Instagram and Twitter and call
Charging time:- takes more than 2.5hrs with box charger and with 12w 1.50Hrs
Performance:- Same like iPhone 11,11pro,11pro max (A13bionic chip)
Pubg runs in HDR-extreme.
Video editing very smoothly
Screen size:-4.7” inch only before buy check the phone in nearest store same like iPhone 8,7
But for me it looks very gr8 and ok 👍 for me
Camera :- Outstanding , better than one plus 8, and 8 pro and iPhone xr (I think because of chip used)
Cons:- only battery and chager they bundled very slow charger(only 5watt)
its not for heavy users who wants there phone last a day with heavy usage and movie lover screen is very small for movie and video lover"
15,5,Best in the market!,"One word.. beautiful iphone ❤️ premium feel
Just go for it without any doubt. Superb camera, handy, white color is soo good.
This phone is for someone who don't like big screen phones."
16,4,Nice product,"Let's face it. The main reason you're even considering this is because you want a compact phone that doesn't compromise on power. Getting OS updates for another 4-5 years, with a decent camera, waterproofing and wireless charging is just an added advantage.

There's a few things it could've done better:

1. Battery is barely adequate for a day of moderate usage.
2. The bezels could have been reduced to have more screen to body ratio.
3. Night mode for the camera was a software feature that the A13 could smoothly implement.
4. Fast charging

....Among others.

But you knew all this already. It's been covered by almost every possible tech reviewer, news agency and social media platform. If you're still here in the reviews, you're just looking for a reason to justify the decision you've already made.

If you're taking the leap from an Android phone(or anything before an iPhone 8), and miss the portability that phones used to have, just go for it. You won't be disappointed. The learning curve of going back to a small screen is minimal.

For all the hate apple gets, it does know build quality (both hardware and software). The SE is no different.
It will last for at least 3 years with basic care. The phone will not slow down, it won't crash, it will still be as secure as it is today.

If you can afford the iPhone 11 now, or have the patience to wait for the iPhone 12 - Do it!

But if you want the nostalgia of simpler times, the performance of a flagship device, and are not averse to carrying a power brick/bank with you. This one is for you."
17,5,Highly recommended,best compact phone i ever have.It has pretty good camera and performance.I have iphone 11pro but now i fall in love with this phone.Best phone👍👍.Go for it if u love small size phone👍👍👍
18,5,Just wow!,"Small yet powerful phone. I am posting this review after nearly 1 month of usage.

1. Performance of the phone is awesome. There is no lag experienced in using any application, games, etc.
2. Battery of the phone is good. It easily lasts 1 day with full day usage of internet like mails, apps, photos, surfing, etc and calling also. This phone is for moderate phone users not gamers ( from battery point of view) . Else you may have to charge it twice a day for heavy usage. For moderate users like me it easily gave 6 hrs screen time. So all in all battery backup is good.
3. Design of the phone is very comfortable. Traditional iPhone design. Distinguished from other phones and one can spot that easily. You can use it with one hand and screen is big enough to do all routine tasks. Build quality is excellent and it feels when you hold it. Very robust design. Haptic Touch feature is unique and nice.
4. Price is a bit high. It costed me around 39k which could have been 3-4K less.
5. Camera quality and features are excellent for a single camera system. It takes photos that are much better than dual and triple camera phones out there in the market.
6. Connectivity of the phone is excellent. There are loads of accessories that you can attach to this phone with wire and wirelessly.
7. Sound quality is good. It has two speakers, one at the bottom and other in earpiece. Call quality is also good.

Go and buy."
19,1,Unsatisfactory,"Everything is fine of this mobile except battery.

Battery consumption at 8-10% Brightness in
Video call : almost 4% reduction for every 5-6 mins.
Phone call : almost 1% reduction for every 4-5 mins.

Which seems to be bit faster consumption. First iPhone I’m using. I’m not sure about regular battery consumption rate. But this doesn’t look nice to me."
20,5,Perfect product!,"The powerful small phone that I always wished for !!

Nowadays the fad is big screen phones but for me, I like a small powerful phone with awesome camera. Ticked all the boxes that I had in my mind.

Switched from android. Never going back!"
21,5,Wonderful,"Like It, Apple SE very nice and handy mobile, we can use it by single hand, like it too much if you are going single handy mobile you can go with Apple SE 2020 without any hesitation."
22,5,Super!,"After using this Device as my daily driver for over a month i can say that , It’s inbuilt AI and Machine Learning is so good that it manages all my things by itself, and even after having a small battery of 1800 MAH, it performs all day with some juice left, which is impressive. Awesome Camera, amazing Performance thanks to A13 Bionic.
Suggestion go for 128GB it will help you in long run. Overall a very good and nice product."
23,5,Best in the market!,"As being a frequent apple user, I couldn't find much of a difference when comparing to IPhone 6.The size and display are the same of IPhone 6 and ofcourse there is 0 negative comments for the A13 chip. It is super fast✌️.

Overall it's the same iPhone 6 with an A13 chip and the generation updates a smartphone can get in 2020.

No negative comments for the camera, apple is always the topper in capturing moments and SE2 has got the studio lights, a front facing portrait camera, a wider photo frame and much more features.

To be honest the cost is a bit higher, iPhone 7 plus can also be considered with this price tag and if you're someone curious in updations, go for it.

The only con side that i have noticed is with the phone charging capability as it is taking a lot more time a smart phone can get charged in this 2020.Almost took an hour to reach 30% of charge.

Must note this point☝️😵

The above said all are true to my knowledge and always listen to multiple opinions before you go for it."
24,5,Classy product,"First of all we will talk about battery it has 1800 mah battery ,but u know what it works like 4000 mah truly amazing phone with optical image stabilisation in video with editing option 64 gb variant is too good go for it"
25,5,Best in this budget,"This is an amazing phone for the price. For someone coming from a pure Android background, migrating data would take a little time, and the battery backup may be quite less for the first 1-2 days. Once it is all set, I felt that the phone gives a decent battery backup. The backup with the ~1800mAh battery on this phone is somewhat comparable to that of an Android with twice the capacity.
Camera is amazing for my use, as the lighting and colour tone are Natural, close to what we would see with our bare eyes. I did not see any grains kicking in during low light conditions.

Since the phone is relatively small, and since I personally prefer this size, it feels amazing in hand.

One thing that could have been better is the charger that is shipped with the phone. Even though the phone supports fast charging, it is shipped with a 5V 1A charger. With it, the phone takes around 1.5 hours to go from 20% - 100%. Not a bad number, but it would be better to have the 12W charger in the box.

Overall, this is the best phone in this price segment."
26,5,Terrific,"This is my first iPhone. And after using it for 6 continuous days the difference between my previous Sony XZS Android and this iPhone is easily noticeable. The camera is better in every way. The only thing I miss about my previous phone is the 960 frame/sec super slow motion recording. Performance is way too better than android. This is fast, very very fast. If your eyes are not glued with the screen the battery life is ok. In fact this is the only issue with this phone. This one fits in my one hand very comfortably which I love the most. In single word this is the RED DAGGER for android flagships phones."
27,5,Just wow!,"I switched from iPhone 8 to iPhone SE instead of going for iPhone 11 since SE comes with same power and great camera with a device size I can easily use and hold in my single hand. I got this delivered within one day of being available in India and it’s just great. I am a big fan of iOS and I’m deep into the Apple ecosystem with my iPad, MacBook, AirPods and an old iPod and I’m not disappointed here too. To those of you who are wondering how is it different from iPhone 8 since it practically looks the same, so some points for you
- the Apple logo at the back is bigger and the in the middle of the phone (that is logo position has changed)
- the portrait mode!! I mean this is an amazing feature
- the camera clarity- you may think the megapixel is same so the picture quality won’t have changed but that’s where you are wrong and the camera is way better and the pictures are real.
- some new display screens have been added
- it’s way more powerful and faster.
-brighter display
To those who don’t want to shell a lot of money and yet enjoy this amazing world of iOS then do not hesitate as iPhone SE will make it fall in love with you."
28,5,Perfect product!,"Finally most awaited first iPhone came within 3 days of order

iPhone SE in one line A powerful performance in compact design and affordable rates

First iPhone in life where you compare each and every functionality with your previous android phone.

Pros
* Powerful chip at affordable price
* Suitable who want to back to having experience of compact screen phone without bazzels.
* Powerful camera experience with A13 Bionic chip image processing power
* My personally favourite I always prefer Touch ID is more secured way of authentication then Face ID

Cons
* Not suitable for gammers due to battery and small screen
* Not suitable for people who want to enjoy playing videos and wanted big and brightest screen.
* No Memoji support in SE which is not able to understand why they do that."
29,5,Just wow!,Most amazing camera in iphone 👌 that is my personal ask I'm Finally buy my First i phone and that latest processor and All new things amazed you it's sooo Handy and enjoyable to Use. And beat other I phones now so enjoyed it.
30,5,Awesome,"Brilliant performance everything is best if you compatible with small screen but battery is average , premium looks sound quality awesome handy phone camera quality ❤️❤️❤️
Thanks flipkart."
31,3,Does the job,"Writing this review after around 1 week of use.
Updating this review after a further 2 weeks of use.

Initially, there was some heating on the phone, but on further use that problem has disappeared. Got to explore the camera a bit more and found it to be very good, the stability on the video is also good.

Pros -
1. Good Camera Quality. Image quality is very good. Pictures are sharp. Good performance in bokeh mode.
2. Good performance. The phone has no lags so far, it is very smooth and fast to use. The response time is less and smooth for all the apps and touch I'd.

Cons -
1. Small battery capacity. The battery is really small, for medium users it takes atleast charging it twice in a day. Not a phone for gamers. Battery capacity prohibits you from using complete advantage of the fastest A13 bionic chip.
2. Camera does not have night mode, without night mode pictures in low light is not good.

The phone is compact, fits in your hand easily and has large bezels, but overall phone looks really sleek and has premium look.

The real disadvantage of this phone is it's small battery, it does have support of fast charging for which you will have to purchase adapter separately, so if you want an iphone and your budget is around this phone only, you can go for it, with the option of fast charger. Otherwise go for iphone 11."
32,4,Go for it without any hesitation.,"Honest advice : Don't watch any tech reviewer's videos before buying this beast.

I purchased this product on 6th June,2020 and here is my honest review :

1. Device looks small but the way it works is truly amazing.
2. if you are switching from ~6"" screen , it is going to be troublesome for a while.
3. 1821 mah battery . 0 to 100% charging time is around 130 minutes. Fast charging/wireless charging is supported but fast charger is not included in box.
4. Gaming Experience is amazing BUT playing on small screen , which is as small as 4.7"" is challenging. PUBG mobile can be played at HD extreme setting. Played for ~2.5 hours with 30% drain.
5. Camera 12MP R / 7 MP F is decent combo. Low light photography not that great.
6. Dual sim : 1 physical nano sim + Esim(at this point only Airtel and JIO are providing Esim facility in India).
7. A13 bionic chipset is here to stay and will be supported by apple for next ~3 - 4 years, so updates will be available and device wont get slowed down."
33,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"This is a beast. Smaller yet powerful. Sleek design and a Beauty.
I will give straight reason for:

Why to buy?
1. If you want an iPhone
2. If this is your first one
3. If you want a small screen phone just for working purpose no entertainment
4. If you have another phone as backup
5. If you have other apple products and you want to pair this up as your latest purchase.
6. If you have a decent 42k to spend without any second thought.

Why not to buy?
1. Battery drain, and low battery capacity
2. If you are a gamer.
3. If you are hardcore user
4. If you already have used bigger screen models

The only concrete drawback the phone has is the battery capacity, since it also supports wireless charging, you can get a decent charge quickly yet its for normal use only.
You will love it if you love apple products and trust me Go for the RED, if you want to create an impression with this sweet little beauty.

Hope that it clears your mind."
34,4,Very Good,"Got it yesterday 11 June ordered on 30may seller shipped on 7 June
What’s happening Flipkart ?
Coming to the phone.
I switched from my old Se .
CAMERA: it’s just Awesome in every way but those portraits lighting effects are of no use obviously mostly they won’t be used by anyone
BATTERY: it’s just average it only remains for 6 to 8 hours of moderate usage
DISPLAY: coming from four inch screen to 4.7 I feel like it’s huge and fair enough ( I always prefer compact phones )
Touch ID : it’s way faster than Face ID I guess coz you need not to look into it it will be opened if you placed your finger from the pocket itself. And it’s no longer a button like the old Se it’s a sensor with gives the haptic feedback
And yeah the product RED is an eye catching one !"
35,5,Brilliant,"For ppl who prefer small displays this is the ryt choice neat n clean top notch performance ......
FOR THOSE WHO R CONCERNED ABOUT BATTERY
This has 1821mAh battery but combined with a13 chip efficency is top notch

. Use 10W charger which comes with ipad or buy separately within 45 mins phone charger from 0-80% The 5w included in box is waste good for nothing

. Switch off optimised battery charging under battery health settings so 80-100% will b charged quickly

.I use social media apps like insta watsapp snap etc and 2hr YouTube avg throughout the the day and made calls through sim and whatsapp still its giving 7.5HR SCREEN ON TIME which is a good thing.

.Video calling consumes more battery like every 2mins it’ll consume 1%

.Gamers will b little disappointed with this one coz PUBG mobile can finish a 100% charge in 2h40mins
PEOPLE WHO DONT PLAY GAMES MUCH DONT THNK TWICE GO FOR IT ..PERFORMANCE IS ROCK SOLID"
36,5,Awesome,"I jumped from old SE to the new SE.the screen to body sized ratio is perfect for usage for a medium size palm.
The highlight of this product is it’s elegance and sleek design. Looks so good in white colour.
Performance is well packed with well coordinated GPU and CPU.
If u are using bezel less phones then u might not consider it. But if u have decided to buy it then this product will bring a huge smile on your face in terms of speed, CAMERA, looks, iOS ecosystem and longevity of this device.
Battery is one section of this phone which will disappoint you but as i don’t play games this device is giving me 5-6 hrs of usage time (you tube, camera,music, browsing,etc etc)
M using white colour with product red apple leather case. This is the perfect contrast with white colour.
Overall rating-8/10
just because of battery performance."
37,5,Good phone for the price,"Some might say overpriced in India, but below are the PROS and CONS after 3 days of usage:

Pros:
1. Blazing fast processor. Runs everything thrown at it without a stutter.
2. Very good single camera for daylight photography. Night time is good but not great.
3. Optimal screen size for a phone for one hand use.
4. Brilliant looks
5. Battery life is one day when used like a phone. Watch various youtube videos to increase battery life. Optimal use of battery saver mode and screen brightness can always increase its life.
6. Excellent speaker

Cons:
1. This is not an entertainment device given the screen size, so use it accordingly.
2. Battery life is about 1 day with use of social media , 4k videos and photography. Average Screen time around 5.5 hrs.
3. Weak network reception. It loses network in places where other phones might still show 2 towers."
38,5,Highly recommended,"iPhone is well known for slim and super platform for durability and shock proof..
Those who want compact small and handy device cn go for it.
It is good for email surfing, browsing, couple of videos per day.
Camera quality is not superb but good in day light
Video is extraordinary i can say
Performance speed is tremendous
Battery approx 1800mah is equivalent to 4000mah of other brands.

White color stand unique in crowd.. because black color become traditional for all mobile handsets..
Can go for red one as well."
39,5,Super!,"My first iPhone and very happy with it. Slick and gorgeous design with perfect compact mobile. Performance is so amazing ,display softness more than 5 *. Little bit battery issues for fast drains like need to charge once in a 12 hours. May be this will solve out in next update. Definitely worth to buy than other brands."
40,4,Worth the money,"This is my first iPhone. I would say that coming from Android, there are some times when I feel that it is restricted in certain ways and you just have to accept it.

Coming to the phone itself, camera is amazing minus the low light photography part. Battery backup is ok ok. I bought 12W Apple charger separately which charges it pretty fast so I do not worry about battery being low. Also since I am mostly at home, it doesn’t matter so much. Display is ok. Its a nice display but a small one and has huge bezels ofcourse. But good thing is you can reach the entire screen with one hand.

Overall yes I would recommend it since iPhones have great value for money in the long run. It is very capable phone but if you play pubg or any heavy game, battery will tale a hit."
41,5,Highly recommended,"I had been eagerly waiting for iPhone SE 2 ever since its news and articles started floating around techsites around a year back. I was using the iPhone SE (previous gen) back then and it worked brilliantly for two years before its Battery health went below 80%.

An android user will never understand why an iPhone user sticks to their ecosystem despite them being expensive.

Pros of iPhone SE 2020
1. A13 bionic chip - makes the phone a beast
2. Camera - has portrait mode. Does the job brilliantly
3. Form factor - nor too huge and nor too small - a perfect size
4. 64gb sufficient for my usage

Cons:
Battery back up is the only real con. If you are a light to moderate user, battery should last about a day.

I am using spigen transparent case for my Red iPhone SE 2020."
42,4,Value-for-money,"This is the first iPhone I hv bought .. It’s bit diff for me using this first first as for so many years I hv been using android.. but I am actually liking it .. The camera omg it’s really awesome .. like it feels classy using this .. Battery is also as of now good enough .. I am writing this review after using it for 40 days.. if anyone is thinking of buying this pls go for it ..
Thanks."
43,4,Very Good,"Great performance....!!!!!
As expected from the A13 Bionic. Battery life can be avg or good depending on personal use . Have to charge the phone at least twice a day . Best Single camera setup . It is a compact phone , not quite great for video content. Great buy for 31k ."
44,5,Terrific purchase,Its a great product. Would have given more than 5 star for the performance. Camera quality is much better than 20MP . And it operates at lighting fast pace. The only small minus point is battery. A but as i am a moderate user its perfectly fine for me. Great product as usual from apple.🙌🏻
45,5,Terrific,"One of the best handsets, very easy to carry & handle. Exceptional performance & amazing display, however battery is the only concern. It consumes more battery when you use internet, especially streaming videos and also while taking pictures. Otherwise everything thing is perfect. People who don’t like to carry big handsets on pocket can definitely go for this. But remember if you play more games or if u r always on internet you might need to carry a fast charger."
46,4,Value-for-money,"USP:
1. Compact mobile which i always wanted in iPhone models
2. Kickass A13 bionic chip , one of the best energy efficient apple processor produced till date.
3. Camera is awesome to take pics (only day time) 4K videos 30/60 fps.

Downside:
1. Battery drain very fast.(googled and made it battery efficient) now it last atleast 1.5 day with moderate usage.

Note: i would not advice this compact super mobile for people who are always glued to social media and YouTube.

This is for someone who wants mobile as one time investment which can be used for atleast 7+ yrs"
47,5,Must buy!,"Very nice phone. Actually it's my first iPhone so I was very excited. Nd I'm happy with this phone.
Nice phone for gaming, battery backup is not that much for gaming but I suggest buy one good powerbank or fast charger. If u have small fingers then it's best device for u."
48,5,Brilliant,"Very handy and comfortable to hold. Best phone to buy if you want sleek design, powerfull processor, beautiful camera and that's fits in your pocket. I didn't hesitate while buying this phone instead of oneplus 8. Afterall its your choice whether you want a phone or a tab sized phone.
P.S.- it's not that small."

battery life - not so good.
voice clarity is fine.
I am not a gamer neither a photographer.

93,5,Super!,"This is good phone for someone who never used iphone yet but of someone using/used any one of iphone 6 , 7 and/or 8 then there is no much difference between the features except performance. With the provided features the price is too high for this phone. If someone is looking for upgrading then I would strongly suggest you to go for iPhone XS or later versions. This is completely my own opinion and please read other reviews as well before making a decision to purchase this product."
94,5,Super!Little Champ is here!,"In one word its Superb, Ignore negetive comments regarding Battery life,Its stays easyly a day for Ofiicial work Purpose.Build quality,Camera,Speaker Out put(Earpiece and Phone speaker)is top notch and apple airpod is just cherry on top..i have switched from 6 inch display to this phone not at all any issue.super smooth ios a big thumps up!

overall its a fantastic gadget."
95,4,Pretty good,"Been using it for almost a year now. I switched to this phone from Samsung galaxy a50 and it was really hard getting used to a 4.7 inch screen from a 6.4 inch one. However, with time i got used to the display and it feels just like any standard display. The display panel is 750p which would look blurry if the screen of this phone was bigger. As it has a smaller screen the pixels are packed close to each other which results in a sharp looking display. Coming to the battery life of this phone, it can last an entire day if you’re not a heavy user. I mostly stay at home so i need to charge it two times a day and I don’t use my phone much when I’m outside. So you’ll have 25-40 percent battery remaining when you get back home in the evening but I recommend to carry a power-bank with you if possible. The battery health of my phone has dropped down to 93 percent. I purchased this phone in October 2020 and it’s 5th October as I’m writing this review. The only way to slow down the battery health of an iphone is to not let the battery drop below 35-40 percent. I don’t know if this happened with anyone else or not but when i go to sleep and the phone is idle, the battery drops 20-25 percent every night without even using the phone. Maybe it’s because there’s no network in my area and when there is no network, any smartphone tries to find network which results in battery drain. Now, the camera. I don’t think i need to say much about the camera of this phone. I’ll just say it’s “Absolutely breathtaking”. To get an amazing shot, all you need to do is get enough light that’s it. While in indoor lighting the image quality is not too bad, it’s fantastic in good lighting conditions. I would say it’s the best camera in this price range. Now the performance. Again, not much to say. A13 Bionic is still a very powerful processor. Everything opens very quickly and the best thing about iphones is that the of the phone after a few years remains the same as day one unlike almost every android phone."
96,5,Highly recommended,"Loved it!
12 MP single camera does its job better than many flagship camera phones. Very compact and perfect for single hand use. Battery lasts at least one day for a normal use."
97,4,Nice product,"It’s a beast in performance, only thing that I didn’t like is it lacks night mode for low light photography. Battery backup is quite average only light to medium users can live with it, not meant for heavy users. It can handle each and every task very easily. Doesn’t break a sweat no matter what you throw at it, whether a heavy gameplay or exporting/rendering of heavy videos. Fits perfectly in pocket as well as in hand. I’ve been using it for more than 9 months. It is really a great device if you can live with the flaws mentioned above. And it’s my first time experiencing ios, and it is extremely smooth and optimised.
Thanks."
98,5,Worth every penny,Amazing phone with beast performance and super value for money if you wanna be in apple eco system this is great device for you.
99,5,Perfecto !,"1 Week after using the phone I am Simply Loving it!
I did a lot of research and was confused in Iphone XR, SE 2020 and One plus 8

If you are Ok with older design/big bezels or looking for GREAT Camera in budget phone or moving from Android to IOS, this phone is best for you.
Camera(Portrait in selfie mode), Build quality, A13 Bionic Chip, Compact design, latest OS(software support for at least 4 years) is simply Bang On!

Downs :
Night mode Camera quality is not good.
Battery is not the best!

The Ups clearly overcomes the Downs."
100,5,Great product,"Amazing Performance. If you are upgrading from an android, don't expect the battery life to be better. But if you upgrading from an Iphone 6, 7 or maybe 8, you will feel the difference. You can experience the speed with the A13 Bionic Chip. Camera Quality has improved. The best part is it's price. In this price you are getting a compact Iphone 11 Pro.
If you are looking to own an Iphone, you should 100% go for this."
101,5,Great product,"13 MP Back Camera More Better than 64mp camera phone's and 7MP Front Camera Same as that.
1845 Mah Batter then any other 5000 mah Smartphones Battery
most precious part The Bionic13 Chipset in this price range just Awesome"
102,5,Must buy!,"Trust me its best phone under 30k or 40k , i bought it for 25k and i am sooo happy with it."
103,4,Really Nice,"Good for normal use like browsing and not recommended for gaming because of small screen size,overall a good product from apple."
104,5,Great product,"Firstly you all need to understand there is a crowd in this Huge Market for whom the ONLY THING WHICH MATTERS IS COMPACT SIZE. And probably phone companies are unable to understand this consumer behaviour. This market was not catered by any other company except to an extent by Google Pixel. Please remember each and every consumer who buys this phone is buying Primarily for its compact size. The dimensions are amazing, which overrides any other shortfall of the device such as battery, Screen size, etc. The price is for Size and Brand of Apple and yes A13 Bionic chip permformance. Many other brands will start entering this segment . Now in future whichver company brings similar size phone with better feature would rule that segment. Small or Compact phone industry will be having some fixed industry parameters such as Width less than 68mm, Thickness less than 7.5 mm etc. Yes screen size could have been improved within the same dimensions. But Apple or any other company will surely overcome this in new phones. People want to get rid of Bulky devices. Hands are mostly busy while driving, commuting, working. People want mobilty to operate a device with a single hand. Thats the LUXURY for which you are going to pay. Taking out a device from pocket shouldnt be a two hand game or a game which requires a lot of effort. People want COMFORT. That is the price , That is the Feature for which you are paying hefty. Design also comes with a price. It is not always whats inside the phone. Apple has brought this device after a long global research. Indian Consumers wont take this device happily is a known thing. I have seen so many wrong comparisons by many well known YouTubers. You cannot Compare this device with Samsung A51 or OnePlus 8 just because they are priced similar. There is no competition for this device as of now. Closest would be Samsung S10e and the Upcoming Google Pixel Device."
105,5,Excellent,"Mini Black Beast
Who likes handy best option with solid device and super fast performance
Battery stands for 4 to 5 hrs.
Over all satisfied as a first time iPhone user

Favourites in this device speed,ui, camera portrait image features, mini device with solid build."
106,4,Pretty good,The phone is amazing according to me.. just some cons r the battery life and the big bezels .. the small phone is all I needed .. and it feels so much secure in one hand.. i needed exactly this type of phone which i can use one handed and have the beast like performance.. previously i was using a 5 inch phone Nokia 3 so the shift according to size is giving the same feel.. one thing that bothering me is the keyboard… even its approx the same size phone but keyboard is too tight to type.. it will take time to adopt no doubt and the fingers are getting fatigued.. these are the cons only … the pros are ends thats the reason I bought this and i am more than happy ..
107,5,Terrific,"I have been an android user since the beginning! I have used phones like poco f1 which had the flagship chips at their time but honestly speaking the performance on this device is just out of the competition! I was very skeptical by some bad reviews on internet, but to my very frank opinion it exceeded my expectations! Some things to keep in mind :
*This phone has not so big display and only supports upto 720p videos on YouTube, so if you watch YouTube all day and love big screens it’s not the device for you, if you occasionally get time to watch youtube and are a working person then this phone is one of the best in class.
*No 3.5mm headphone jack, only lightning connector and included apple earphones which I thought are average but they blew my mind as soon as I listened to them! Much better audio than any android device at that range, plus stereo speaker
*IP67 rated so sweat, dust and water resistant
*This is a dual sim device but only one physical sim and one eSIM! Now frankly eSIM is awesome to use! I use single sim but still I converted my sim into eSIM and there’s no physical sim inside my phone now! Very easy! Just a message and you’ll get a barcode just scan that in add mobile data plan in settings and your eSIM will be activated within 2 hours!
*THE BEST THING ABOUT THIS PHONE IS ITS CAMERA! It has a single camera but this price worth every penny of the camera! Amazing Dynamic range and colours! Beautiful! Front camera is good too, nothing exceptional! So if you’re a selfie freak this might not be right for you! And video recording in this range no phone comes near in quality of this phone!
*Battery life on this phone is better than average! I use my phone 24x7 atleast for social media and it’s giving me 5-6hr of SOT and all day battery life! But if you watch YouTube and fb videos all day long or use Camera a lot then you might have to charge it
*many people debate about its 3gb ram, but I have used 8gb ram phones in past and this 3gb ram phone is better in ram Management than 8gb ram android phones!
*the touch ID or Fingerprint sensor is the best ever fingerprint sensor I’ve ever used, Apple really show their quality in their products, much more secure than stupid face unlock of android devices and better and faster than in display fingerprints too!



So who should buy this phone?
If you’re a person who doesn’t require that edge to edge full view display and just a brilliantly built device with Atleast more than 4 year of upcoming software updates then it’s for you! It has brilliant camera, it has water resistance, stereo speakers, NFC, fastest performance for the price then go for it!"
108,5,Great product,"Writing this review after almost 3 months of usage. This is my first iPhone

I got this delivered on 1st October 2021. The packaging was good.

Coming to the device, I’m currently running iOS 15.2
PROS :
1) Superb build quality
2) Touch ID is blazing fast
3) Camera is very good, especially for videos
4) Signal reception very good
5) Earpiece volume for call is one of the loudest I have seen
6) Wi-Fi calling support with Airtel, Jio and Vodafone Idea (Tried in Mumbai and Maharashtra circle)
7) Wi-Fi signal reception one of the best I’ve experienced
8) Excellent performance from the A13 Bionic Chip, no lags, no heating issues.


CONS :
1) The only major con is the battery life. Hey, don’t get me wrong here. The battery life is not pathetic, you might just need to charge it twice a day on moderate to heavy usage. On average usage, it will easily last you 1 to 1.5 day.
2) The screen size might be a con for some, but this depends on the person, so I won’t count it as a con.
3) Charger should have been provided in the box


Conclusion - if you are new and want to experience iOS ecosystem without spending much on the then expensive iPhone series, you should definitely go for this phone."
109,5,Fabulous!,"Best iPhone in this price range.It can do almost everything an iPhone 11 can do and will get long support for iOS updates.Battery life is very good very few people know how to optimise the iOS according to their needs for battery usage. So I get easily a day of use, many people say heavy usage consumes battery life that's true for any smartphone even iPhone 11."
110,5,Great product,"Amazing Performance. If you are upgrading from an android, don't expect the battery life to be better. But if you upgrading from an Iphone 6, 7 or maybe 8, you will feel the difference. You can experience the speed with the A13 Bionic Chip. Camera Quality has improved. The best part is it's price. In this price you are getting a compact Iphone 11 Pro.
If you are looking to own an Iphone, you should 100% go for this."
111,5,Great product,"13 MP Back Camera More Better than 64mp camera phone's and 7MP Front Camera Same as that.
1845 Mah Batter then any other 5000 mah Smartphones Battery
most precious part The Bionic13 Chipset in this price range just Awesome"
112,5,Must buy!,"Trust me its best phone under 30k or 40k , i bought it for 25k and i am sooo happy with it."
113,4,Really Nice,"Good for normal use like browsing and not recommended for gaming because of small screen size,overall a good product from apple."
114,5,Great product,"Firstly you all need to understand there is a crowd in this Huge Market for whom the ONLY THING WHICH MATTERS IS COMPACT SIZE. And probably phone companies are unable to understand this consumer behaviour. This market was not catered by any other company except to an extent by Google Pixel. Please remember each and every consumer who buys this phone is buying Primarily for its compact size. The dimensions are amazing, which overrides any other shortfall of the device such as battery, Screen size, etc. The price is for Size and Brand of Apple and yes A13 Bionic chip permformance. Many other brands will start entering this segment . Now in future whichver company brings similar size phone with better feature would rule that segment. Small or Compact phone industry will be having some fixed industry parameters such as Width less than 68mm, Thickness less than 7.5 mm etc. Yes screen size could have been improved within the same dimensions. But Apple or any other company will surely overcome this in new phones. People want to get rid of Bulky devices. Hands are mostly busy while driving, commuting, working. People want mobilty to operate a device with a single hand. Thats the LUXURY for which you are going to pay. Taking out a device from pocket shouldnt be a two hand game or a game which requires a lot of effort. People want COMFORT. That is the price , That is the Feature for which you are paying hefty. Design also comes with a price. It is not always whats inside the phone. Apple has brought this device after a long global research. Indian Consumers wont take this device happily is a known thing. I have seen so many wrong comparisons by many well known YouTubers. You cannot Compare this device with Samsung A51 or OnePlus 8 just because they are priced similar. There is no competition for this device as of now. Closest would be Samsung S10e and the Upcoming Google Pixel Device."
115,5,Excellent,"Mini Black Beast
Who likes handy best option with solid device and super fast performance
Battery stands for 4 to 5 hrs.
Over all satisfied as a first time iPhone user

Favourites in this device speed,ui, camera portrait image features, mini device with solid build."
116,4,Pretty good,The phone is amazing according to me.. just some cons r the battery life and the big bezels .. the small phone is all I needed .. and it feels so much secure in one hand.. i needed exactly this type of phone which i can use one handed and have the beast like performance.. previously i was using a 5 inch phone Nokia 3 so the shift according to size is giving the same feel.. one thing that bothering me is the keyboard… even its approx the same size phone but keyboard is too tight to type.. it will take time to adopt no doubt and the fingers are getting fatigued.. these are the cons only … the pros are ends thats the reason I bought this and i am more than happy ..
117,5,Terrific,"I have been an android user since the beginning! I have used phones like poco f1 which had the flagship chips at their time but honestly speaking the performance on this device is just out of the competition! I was very skeptical by some bad reviews on internet, but to my very frank opinion it exceeded my expectations! Some things to keep in mind :
*This phone has not so big display and only supports upto 720p videos on YouTube, so if you watch YouTube all day and love big screens it’s not the device for you, if you occasionally get time to watch youtube and are a working person then this phone is one of the best in class.
*No 3.5mm headphone jack, only lightning connector and included apple earphones which I thought are average but they blew my mind as soon as I listened to them! Much better audio than any android device at that range, plus stereo speaker
*IP67 rated so sweat, dust and water resistant
*This is a dual sim device but only one physical sim and one eSIM! Now frankly eSIM is awesome to use! I use single sim but still I converted my sim into eSIM and there’s no physical sim inside my phone now! Very easy! Just a message and you’ll get a barcode just scan that in add mobile data plan in settings and your eSIM will be activated within 2 hours!
*THE BEST THING ABOUT THIS PHONE IS ITS CAMERA! It has a single camera but this price worth every penny of the camera! Amazing Dynamic range and colours! Beautiful! Front camera is good too, nothing exceptional! So if you’re a selfie freak this might not be right for you! And video recording in this range no phone comes near in quality of this phone!
*Battery life on this phone is better than average! I use my phone 24x7 atleast for social media and it’s giving me 5-6hr of SOT and all day battery life! But if you watch YouTube and fb videos all day long or use Camera a lot then you might have to charge it
*many people debate about its 3gb ram, but I have used 8gb ram phones in past and this 3gb ram phone is better in ram Management than 8gb ram android phones!
*the touch ID or Fingerprint sensor is the best ever fingerprint sensor I’ve ever used, Apple really show their quality in their products, much more secure than stupid face unlock of android devices and better and faster than in display fingerprints too!



So who should buy this phone?
If you’re a person who doesn’t require that edge to edge full view display and just a brilliantly built device with Atleast more than 4 year of upcoming software updates then it’s for you! It has brilliant camera, it has water resistance, stereo speakers, NFC, fastest performance for the price then go for it!"
118,5,Great product,"Writing this review after almost 3 months of usage. This is my first iPhone

I got this delivered on 1st October 2021. The packaging was good.

Coming to the device, I’m currently running iOS 15.2
PROS :
1) Superb build quality
2) Touch ID is blazing fast
3) Camera is very good, especially for videos
4) Signal reception very good
5) Earpiece volume for call is one of the loudest I have seen
6) Wi-Fi calling support with Airtel, Jio and Vodafone Idea (Tried in Mumbai and Maharashtra circle)
7) Wi-Fi signal reception one of the best I’ve experienced
8) Excellent performance from the A13 Bionic Chip, no lags, no heating issues.


CONS :
1) The only major con is the battery life. Hey, don’t get me wrong here. The battery life is not pathetic, you might just need to charge it twice a day on moderate to heavy usage. On average usage, it will easily last you 1 to 1.5 day.
2) The screen size might be a con for some, but this depends on the person, so I won’t count it as a con.
3) Charger should have been provided in the box


Conclusion - if you are new and want to experience iOS ecosystem without spending much on the then expensive iPhone series, you should definitely go for this phone."

120,5,Great product,"Best product but apple could have launched it in very less price.
Screensjze comparatively small
Beterry performance satisfactory
Camera extra ordinarily
Sensors and apps way fast and results jn blink


Buy if price around 25 max"
121,5,Simply awesome,It's a good phone for who like handy phones. But when its come to battery backup it's a worst thing. Performance of the phone is good
122,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"I have been using iphones for a long time
iPhone 4s - iphone 5s - iphone 6s ,
So when time came to change, I had to chose between iphone11 and iphone SE2020.

Now I chose SE2020 and I am happy with the purchase.

Main reason for choosing SE2020 was the latest CPU and fingerprint scanner.
I am not comfortable with Face ID .

The Phone Size seems small but for someone used to iphone 6S, it seems the same !!

Don't want to admit this but well, I would have loved to get iphone 11 but then 20k increase in cost was a little too much. Also no fingerprint

So I chose the next best thing and I don't regret it for a sec."
123,5,Super!,"First of all thank u apple for making such good phone.
Guys this phone is Powerhouse with best processor.
Camera is too good in light, I mean best, but don’t expect great pics in night.
Battery life is good according to size and display of phone, keep one fast charger with u and forget about battery issue because there is no issue with battery if u are not a hardcore gamer. It gives u full day with battery with moderate use. Charging in 30 minutes with 12 watt charger is 50 to 60%. I guess very fast it is.
Gaming beast, superb display, smooth, forget bezels it’s apple phone.
Superb speakers.
Overall in this price range it is worth buying. Again I tell u if u have a fast charger, battery of this phone is great.
Feels premium in hand and very easy to use with one hand."
124,5,Classy product,It is a very good device. You will feel how premium is it whenever you hold in your hand. It is very nice to hold. And size is just perfect! Above all it has the best camera. See the attached picture which I clicked in the evening.You should go for the red one!
125,4,Delightful,Firstly i got this phone for 24.5k so i would say it was a good bargain for me to get my first iphone . Keeping this price in kind the performance of this phone is just awesome . I am not much of a person who consumes lot of video content for me its a device which does its jobs very nicely . Battery is bad for any average user but since i use it mostly for calls texts and some banking apps it serves the purpose. This phone is for people who dont much of their time on phone and want a compact and powerfull device with all security features for a long run.
126,5,Brilliant,"I was aware of that this is a fantastic phone except the battary life before purchase. But I have specific use case as follows
1. I use it as business phone with lots of phone calls during a day.
2. I do not have social media presence. Even the whatsapp is not installed. (I have whatsapp on second phone which I keep it at home and it works on home wifi). I only use imessage for close family members.
3. It has all my business outlook email, calender, notes, Gmail is configured to inbuilt apple mailbox. Half a dozens of all my banking apps installed.
4. Had realme buds air which works so seamless with this phone. Earlier i was using them with samsung A50 and thought they are just copy by looks and I stooped using them as there were many connection issues. Now I can understand why people praise so much about apples Airbuds. I receive the call on phone and open the flap of realme buds air and it gets connected automatically in less then 2 seconds. It was a super pleasant experience.
5. I am getting more than full day of a battary life even after starting a day with about 85 to 90%. I try to keep battary charge between 20 to 90%
6. I have a PD fast charger in car which can really top up about 50% in my 20 min run to and from office.
7. I always wanted a compact and reliable phone which I can count on.
8. Additional plus points are superb built quality, awesome in hand premium feeling and a terrific camera.
7. In nutshell, it works extremely well for ""ME"". It will work for u in you have similar use case."
127,5,Worth every penny,It's budget phone overall is the best only bantery backup is not god but if u then 4k video watching or shooting it's best option for 4k videos lover
128,5,Terrific purchase,"Fantastic phone, in a beautiful form factor, handy, ergonomic and power packed device. Please do not go by the reviews of ""PUBG chipmunks"", who are looking for a device for gaming purposes. This is the perfect phone for no non sense every day users, who would like to make calls,browse the internet, use mail clients and do social networking."
129,5,Brilliant,"Phone is absolutely beast in terms of performance and camera. But there are certain things before purchasing an IPhone verses an android phone

Following are major differences between IOS and android:
1. Calling interface of iOS is very old. contacts, dialer and recent calls all are in separate tab. One can not get the contact by directly typing on dialer as like an android phone.
2. Sim selection process for iOS is very difficult. For first time calls are always placed through assigned primary sim. One has to individually set the calling sim for every contacts by editing contacts. IOS will learn automatically by the frequency of SIM calls
3. What’sapp back up can’t be restored on iOS . One will lose all the What’sapp back up from android to iOS.
4. Kind of flexibility that is available on android is not possible in iOS. For example one can’t switch on and off WIFI hotspot from toggle icons. For that you have to go in settings. Also Whether hotshot is on or off is not shown in notifications. So most of the time my hotspot remains on.
Also, the silent mode on or off icon is not shown in top notification centre.
4. IOS gives priority to security. So it will not allow the kind of permissions like android to applications. For example Truecaller does not work exactly like android.
5. When Bluetooth headset is connected and call is received, the call sound is received through iPhone not through headset. For that one has to select the Bluetooth headset option each time after picking up the calls.
6. For first time iOS users, setting up the phone will take much longer time and most will not understand the intricacies of IOS.
7. There are very limited options for settings in toggle up menu of IOS.
8. Many local applications (such as education, local institutes etc) from android store are not available in App Store of IPhone.
9. Notifications or junk messages are not grouped in a single folder like android phones.

I watched many IOS YouTube videos to understand the IOS and for settings. Learning curve for IOS is higher. But once One get the grip of IOS , the phone will feel like a breeze

Now, regarding the iphone SE:
1. Camera is absolutely awesome. It is even better than IPhone XR and daylight photos are comparable to IPhone 11. Indoor lighting photos are not that great and are somewhat grainy. No night mode.
2. On continuous heavy uses battery lasts for 5 to 6 hours but on mild uses, it can easily lasts more than 12 hours. Battery performance can be compared with 3500 mAH batteries of android.
3. The 5W charger is very slow, I use 10W charger that came with IPad for charging. 10 W charger charges the IPhone SE more than 50% in 30 minutes. Beyond 80% charging , it shifts to trickle/ slow charging for enhancing the battery life. For getting the best battery life, always use phone in between 20 to 80% battery. I also use MI power bank for charging IPhone.
4. The sound coming through speakers and headsets is stereo and will beat any 40000 priced phone
3. Resolution difference is not noticeable compared to bigger size phone. The display is bright in sunlight.
4. I was confused between buying IPhone SE and IPhone XR. I preferred IPhone SE for better camera, single hand use, small size, 150gms weight over 190gms of XR. And Touch ID
5. This phone is not for gamers.
6. Touch ID of this phone has multiple use compared to fingerprint sensors of android phone. All payments can be enabled through TouchID with credit cards,
7. The IPhones are standard for video shooting through cameras. Nothing can beat iPhone for video quality of cameras.

Last but not least, after buying the iPhone SE i have started using iPhone for just a phone and iPad for productivity."
130,3,Nice,"It's not the phone that has an issue, it's flipkart. I ordered this phone on 31st of July and promised date was 4th August. But I got the phone on 6th August. Doesn't sound like much of a delay but it becomes a lot when u have a flight coming close and flipkart says your product will be delivered before 10th August. Like I could see clearly the phone is close to me (has reached my nearest hub). Now coming to the phone the display could've been better considering the price, but it's not a bummer by any means. The only downsides I see is the screen size and clarity of the screen. There could be 2 cameras but it rocks with one and can easily beat some of the biggest flagships in the market. The phone is a must have. I shifted to this phone after I brought the iphone 11. So trust me it's a great buy. Just don't trust flipkart when you're on a tight schedule."
131,5,Fabulous!,"Was never a great birthday gift for spouse.

Power pack device. A13 brings life to whole performance. Except screen size and camera, performance wise it's a comparable and affordable device in comparison with 11 pro. Camera too works way better than comparable 12MP devices.

Battery lasts full day for normal usage including couple hours of youtube videos.

Great work Apple."
132,4,Really Nice,"Marking the return of the phone with great performance in a small form factor, this one does make it easy to love it.
A well priced proposition with bang for the buck performance and the iOS level of confidence.
The battery is only average but that can also be improved if you are a little more aware, than the commonwealth, of the system software customisations.
All in all a good phone with a great performance and a decent battery life."
133,5,Fabulous!,"This phone is superb !!! At this budget it is very valuable. The camera,battery,display and sound everything is 100% for this budget. I am very happy with this phone. I have used it 2 months and I haven’t face any problem. I love it!!!"
134,5,Must buy!,"The iPhone se was good but battery could not survive a day, if u r a Android user then I would suggest Mi11x and if u want to try iPhone then u can, but battery life is very important and also have to buy a fast charger seperately can't count the flaws of this device as it is the cheapest iPhone"
135,1,Did not meet expectations,"Users shifted from android to iphone may feel not worthy. In this price range we will get better phone in android But Only satisfactory thing is the Brand and durability
Performance is good
Some automation functions are good
Camera Avg
Fast charging is plus from 20 to 70 % it took 30 to 40 min but to get 100% it took another 2 hours
I liked the size of the mobile so i choose this
The below review is after 5 months of use
Mobile look was quality is good but it is too sensitive it got stopped working display now and Apple care not accepting under warranty and claimng that due to scratches on screen they will not do service. Don't buy this because of they are selling at low cost than initial price. Build quality is not good. Go for other brands save money."
136,4,Excellent Phone,"Camera- 4.5/5 (However if it had dedicated night mode i will give it 5 out of 5)
Performance- 5/5 (A13 Bionic chip is powerful enough to handle any kind of task)
Display- 4/5 (Super color accurate display, but if it have 800 nits of brightness then it will get 5)
Battery- 2.5/5 (Battery is the weakest point of this phone. Although the standby time is great but in very light use i get 4.5 Hours of SOT)
Software- 5/5 (Since it is a apple device so you will get ios updates for long period of time)

Overall Its a great phone and it has an awesome build quality. Since the battery is not great i will not recommend this phone to a power user. And if you are looking for a secondary phone under 30k or you are a very lite user then go ahead and buy this phone. (In Big billion days you can get this phone under 25k)

One more point many Youtubers are saying that is has a very small display, but believe me guys i am using this phone. I can feel that is have a smaller display but not very small. But if try to play PUBG or COD then only you will feel that the display is small."
137,5,Simply awesome,"Breathtaking. Smooth Performance. Amazing Camera and video performance. Dual Sim. Smooth Networks. Ideal for first time Android users, who are doing the switch. Battery Backup is decent. Will last for a day, for a moderate user. Buy it for the A13 Bionic. You won't regret."
138,5,Classy product,"The best budget iPhone you can get.

The camera: great for daylight images, only downside I would say is the lack of night sight, but yeah it does the task. Performance: I will certainly be joking if I said I was experiencing issues with the phone’s performance. It’s A13 for god’s sake. The best processor in the market right now and I feel this is the reason most of us are buying. This phone is gonna last you more than any android in the same price segment will ever do. And that includes One Plus as well.
Display: The Display is more than adequate. U might go for a fancy refresh rate on an android but trust me if u are a casual user u will not be disappointed with this device.
Battery: it’s 1850 mAh so yeah got me through like 10hrs of regular use with still 15% left. Heavy gaming does drain it in 3 hrs or so. But yeah if u want a phone which lasts long on battery go for an android else buy this eyes closed."
139,5,Terrific,The phone is working awesome high speed the only demerit is size if you are okay with the size then you can buy the phone without even reading anything amazing built quality thankyou apple and flipkart the battery is awesome and everything is fine with the phone no problem faced till now
140,4,Good quality product,"iOS is always great for it's fluid and great performance, this phone is no different from that as A13 chip took it to next level.
Cons: Battery could have been better due to increasing dependency on mobiles and apps in this digitized world."
141,5,Terrific,"If you don't know the benefits of the Apple ecosystem, this is the phone to introduce you to it and if you use it properly, you will never go back

It's (comparatively) reasonably priced. In fact given it's processor which is the same as one in iPhone Pro which costs more than a lakh plus Apples' updates thay go on for 5-6 years, it's probably better value than most ""cheaper"" phones out there.

The camera is great and Touch ID in this age of mask wearing is perfect.

Cons - battery isn't as good as larger phones but with screen at lower brightness and decent use I can easily manage the day. Bezels make screen smaller, but I am ok because I use an iPad mini for videos and reading."
142,4,Really Nice,"It's easy to hold, looks good but slippery one. Performance is good. Battery is below average. If you turn off mobile data and use wifi then battery goes little more time. Back camera good in day light only. Front camera just ok ok. Someone who only use for mail, chat then its ok. Better go for iphone 11."
143,4,Value-for-money,"This is one of the best mobile. Since I’m using this phone from last 24 hours and I personally feel that it’s a complete packet. It contains everything, yes its display is bit smaller but you don’t feel if you are comfortable with small phones. The A13 chip set is playing its best role. I personally feel that it’s good for normal person. Not for heavy gamers."
144,4,Worth the money,"After one month of use finding it very nice and good product.exploring new features of ios 14 every day.the photos and selfies are awesome even with a single camera. In short any anyone who wishes to have a power packed, sturdy ,reliable and "" Virus free"" long lasting phone. Iphone SE 2020 is a better alternative ."
145,5,Just wow!,"Ek number fone
Switched from Oneplus 6T to iphone
Majje aagye
Now after using it for a month when i take oneplus in my hand it feels so big in size .
I’m all day mobile user in this period of lockdown so have to charge battery 2 times a day ! But the battery backup is 11-12 hrs while using it to fullest with Bluetooth, wifi and mobile data on.
If I charge 100% fone in the morning then it can easily go till 8 pm in night with full day use
Apple music is so nice that all other music app feels so low quality in comparison to it n one get 6 months apple music subscription free and apple tv for a year.
All over really nice fone!
PREMIUM LOOK ! BEST CAMERA ! FITS IN ONE HAND ! WORTH BUYING"
146,5,Must buy!,"A device that will last for atleast 5 years with the latest softwares at your disposal. A camera you can always trust about its consistency. Very compact . Battery is good, no matter what people say, if you are not gaming or not shooting videos for hours and hours, battery is solid with exceptional standby. Last but not the least, Flipkart was amazing with its services. At every stage. Thank you"

148,4,Wonderful,"My honest review after using it for 5 months.
This phone is good only for those people who don’t have problem with small screen and low battery capacity.
So,
Camera is value for the money videography at 4k 30 & 24 fps which is soo awesome.
Photography is ok but compared to many other android at it’s price range it can beat the image quality.
And the best thing it has a latest processor same as iPhone 11 series so everything thing is sooo smooth
Even tho it has small screen i game a lot. It’...

149,5,Super!,"If battery will be ok, the entire
India will buy this se 2020. All other brand will be failled in India and other parts of world.
As a senior citizen I feel it is easy to handle, waitless and
I proud to have a super engine."
150,5,Fabulous!,"I ordered the Red colored iPhone SE on 2-Jun. Flipkart gave date of delivery on 7-Jun but due to lockdown it got delayed by 3 days and I received on 10-Jun. Good effort by Flipkart during such challenging times.

The looks and feel of the phone is a class apart compared to other Android phones I have used in the past. The colour is awesome and hard to take your eyes off. The Product RED written at the back adds to its esthetic.

It is easier on the grip being smaller and even with a back cover, it's more in control than the larger ones. The box contains phone with charger and headphone.

The sound is much louder and more soothing. When making calls you can hear with ease even a noisy places. The display being smaller comes with its disadvantages when reading mails or typing for longer durations, though the auto spell prediction works with complete ease. You can feel the power of IOS over Android at every moment when using the device be it while viewing videos on WhatsApp or scrolling through content.

To summarise it's a must have if you want ease and comfort of using a smaller mobile.
The build and quality speaks volumes about Apple.
Thanks to Apple and to Flipkart for the HDFC bank discount and choice of colours."
151,5,Classy product,Very cute phone and performance upto the standards of an Apple product. Great value for money but may not be liked by those who watch videos and do gaming with current day larger display phones. A great product all in all.
152,4,Really Nice,"Great performance, battery life is good for compatible users who doesn’t play more games, Good display, handy phone to carry easily... loved it🤍🖤"
153,4,Delightful,"Battery sucks. It lasted 100% for 2 months then 99-96 in just one month
Other things are great
Great camera great processor great screen and handy phone
But there is not that much battery to enjoy it’s features"
154,5,Simply awesome,"Really happy with this device, have come from an iPhone 5S so a significant upgrade in features/performance etc. It might be a little small for some but it ...
Excellent Phone at a Great Price - But With Some Shortcomings..."
155,4,Worth the money,"First iPhone as per my budget, thanks to Flipkart for providing it in a discount price. Purchased it for the strong privacy features of an iOS.
Reviewing after 5 days of use,
Battery: Need to use very sincerely or use 20w adapter for 100% charge in 1 hour.

Camera: Good

Performance: Very good, 1 app to another app opening performance very smooth.

Size: awesome, It's very handy to use by one palm and fingers only.

Keyboard: After using 6inch Android smartphone its takes time to input the data. But, I found its very accurate while typing in a iPhone keyboard compared to android keyboard.


Additional Benefit: 1 Year of Apple TV subscription and 3 months of Apple Arcade.

Let's see after 1 month of use."
156,5,Simply awesome,"Best budget iphone you could buy, i really recommend to those who are Android users and doesn't want to spend much but still want to experience Iphone. Go for it. yeah people will say its battery is bad. If you are using it for long it definitly will not last long. But if you use it as secondary phone its a good chooice."
157,5,Worth every penny,Nice apple product. It works very fast and best performance as A13 bionic chip processor. Camera is also good. Battery life is short only 1 day survive.
158,5,Perfect product!,"I find it best phone in this size and price category. Display, camera, speed all is good, battery life may not look good if you are an extensive user of phone. On an average 2-3 hours of daily screen time, battery lasts for 2 days in one full charge, which is good enough for me.
This size of phone gives comfortable feeling n grip in hand so i find it best."
159,5,Excellent,"Shooting in 4K is like very cinematic. I get a screen time of 6 hours. I use Instagram, some trading apps and switching on hotspot gives a decent battery. Just go for it if you want to buy. Add on 20W charger to your cart. It charges 50% in 30 min.. Super cool to use this little monster.."

The display being smaller comes with its disadvantages when reading mails or typing for longer durations, though the auto spell prediction works with complete ease. You can feel the power of IOS over Android at every moment when using the device be it while viewing videos on WhatsApp or scrolling through content.

To summarise it's a must have if you want ease and comfort of using a smaller mobile.
The build and quality speaks volumes about Apple.
Thanks to Apple and to Flipkart for the HDFC bank discount and choice of colours."
161,5,Classy product,Very cute phone and performance upto the standards of an Apple product. Great value for money but may not be liked by those who watch videos and do gaming with current day larger display phones. A great product all in all.
162,4,Really Nice,"Great performance, battery life is good for compatible users who doesn’t play more games, Good display, handy phone to carry easily... loved it🤍🖤"
163,4,Delightful,"Battery sucks. It lasted 100% for 2 months then 99-96 in just one month
Other things are great
Great camera great processor great screen and handy phone
But there is not that much battery to enjoy it’s features"
164,5,Simply awesome,"Really happy with this device, have come from an iPhone 5S so a significant upgrade in features/performance etc. It might be a little small for some but it ...
Excellent Phone at a Great Price - But With Some Shortcomings..."
165,4,Worth the money,"First iPhone as per my budget, thanks to Flipkart for providing it in a discount price. Purchased it for the strong privacy features of an iOS.
Reviewing after 5 days of use,
Battery: Need to use very sincerely or use 20w adapter for 100% charge in 1 hour.

Camera: Good

Performance: Very good, 1 app to another app opening performance very smooth.

Size: awesome, It's very handy to use by one palm and fingers only.

Keyboard: After using 6inch Android smartphone its takes time to input the data. But, I found its very accurate while typing in a iPhone keyboard compared to android keyboard.


Additional Benefit: 1 Year of Apple TV subscription and 3 months of Apple Arcade.

Let's see after 1 month of use."
166,5,Simply awesome,"Best budget iphone you could buy, i really recommend to those who are Android users and doesn't want to spend much but still want to experience Iphone. Go for it. yeah people will say its battery is bad. If you are using it for long it definitly will not last long. But if you use it as secondary phone its a good chooice."
167,5,Worth every penny,Nice apple product. It works very fast and best performance as A13 bionic chip processor. Camera is also good. Battery life is short only 1 day survive.
168,5,Perfect product!,"I find it best phone in this size and price category. Display, camera, speed all is good, battery life may not look good if you are an extensive user of phone. On an average 2-3 hours of daily screen time, battery lasts for 2 days in one full charge, which is good enough for me.
This size of phone gives comfortable feeling n grip in hand so i find it best."
169,5,Excellent,"Shooting in 4K is like very cinematic. I get a screen time of 6 hours. I use Instagram, some trading apps and switching on hotspot gives a decent battery. Just go for it if you want to buy. Add on 20W charger to your cart. It charges 50% in 30 min.. Super cool to use this little monster.."
170,5,Brilliant,"I bought the phone on the sale at the best price. This phone is really a flagship phone it has all good features of all the earlier models iPhone 6,7 & 8.

Pros

1. The phone size is 4.7” which is very good, better than the other mammoth.
2. Battery backup is adequate one can get a days backup easily with average usage.
3. Cameras quality is unmatched with any androids available in the maker.
4. Memory and RAM are the best in iPhone one does not need to be bothered about it. It’s perfectly managed by iOS.
5. Dual sim concept is managed by one physical sim and second esim making it life saving for people migrating from android phone.

Cons

1. No charger/adapter & EarPods provided in the box, making difficult for first time iPhone users as android phone adapters will not work, as the lighting charging cable provided in the box has usb type-c connector so you have to buy a adapter with usb type-c connector.
2. No 3.5mm earphones jack so you need use a Bluetooth earphones. Luckily any Bluetooth earphones or headphones works which are compatible for Bluetooth v5."
171,5,Classy product,"This is truly fab phone .it is very handy 😀 Camera is superb sound is great. Smooth performance. Se 2020 is my first iPhone
I really love this phone ."
172,5,Must buy!,"Its for only who loves small screen and with a performance beast.. i love it and its awesome..
RATINGS

173,5,Wonderful,"I did not find any issues with battery
Good battery backup
Performance is outstanding
Internet connectivity is outstanding
I m fully satisfied
People saying about battery but i did not find any with battery

Battery giving me a full day backup
I am not gamer not a heavy user
For me it is a beast"
174,4,Good choice,"If you want small size iphone like iphone 7 or 8 then it will best option for you, every thing you through on it just run very smoothly"
175,5,Mind-blowing purchase,Kind of camera in this price range is amazing ... as the user interface is amazingly convenient ... no wonder why after getting an iphone ppl take a step forward for other accessories ...... worth of buying at this price range
176,5,Best in the market!,"It is just so beautiful and I think you should buy it, the camera is a beast, the battery last just fine through out the day with mild use, if ur a heavy user you'd need to charge it maybe but the performance is epic and you get rlly good gameplay, worth the money, btw if ur coming for a larger screen, you might feel it's a lil too small but honestly it's not rlly that small, so buy it, it's perfect."
177,5,Great product,Screen is really really small for media consumer and battery is not a full day usage battery other everything is fine and the camera is amazing overall a great deal with tons of value for money....
178,5,Perfect product!,"This is very great edition in iphone series, and very gud phone specially for whom who want to change from Andriod to iOS and this is my first iOS phone and i am very very to buy this product. It's really very very appreciable work done to Apple.

I am very happy to this product &this is my observation that this product is called value of money.."
179,5,Simply awesome,"I bought iPhone mobile for the first time.
I am really happy with this, my happiness can't express in words.
Camera is awesome
Well Display it's a great product no doubt at all."
180,4,Really Nice,"This is beautiful device which contain iconic A13 bionic chip. Chip makes this little device beast. I also enjoy six months Apple Music and Apple TV one year subscription free.
Pocket friendly device both in terms of money and size."
181,5,Terrific,"iPhone SE comes with 4.7inch display and 64 GB storage capacity.

If you want to buy a smart phone for playing games like that PubG, watching movie in various OTT platform then this is not for you, you can choose One Plus in same price range that will be better chooice for you.

If you are a iPhone lover and able to utilise iPhone properly then only go for it. Basically if you using your mobile phone only for official purpose that means Sending Emails, Using for Whatsapp and other messaging facilities, Using for Banking related applications then blindly go for it. We all are know that for this types of work we need high class security mainly for banking apps and payments sites. I think iPhone is number one security provider for that types of work.

iPhone SE is a super handy with 4.7 inch display and premium looking phone. Please as your requirements choose the better one.

And further I want to share one think that those who are giving negative reviews regarding battery backup they are actually don’t know about iOS. In iOS has option for power consumption optimisation. As per your requirements you can optimise the power uses and get wonderful power backup."
182,5,Highly recommended,"After 2 days of usage!!
It’s a beast!! May it be performance or camera or sound quality, it’s a total beast at its price. 🔥
It degrades every mid tier mobile.
Battery maybe a drawback for some, but according it’s an excellent daily drive mobile. Normal usage would give a nice battery life.
Power bank is proffered to be kept in hand for some.
Camera is exceptional👌🏽
I don’t find any cons at all, to be honest.
The display size is small, yeah.
But it’s so cute and handy to use. And it’s less likely to fall down as it fits your hand perfectly.
Personal opinion, RED colour is exceptionally excellent. 🔥
Go for it if without any second thought. ❤️💯"
183,5,Worth every penny,"Best phone i have ever purchased..tho battery is a bit not good but we can cop up with turning off siri, background app refresher and location services. So with all those turning off battery Backup is good! At 17.00 hours mine was 100% and i have been using continuously till 19:03 now its 73%. Battery is not the best but its good if we manage our use in the best way!!"
184,5,Wonderful,"Excellent performance ,camera , build quality unbeatable . Gives the desired premium feel when in hand. Almost all the feautures of the iPhone 11 in the traditional iphone body ,with glass back!!. The finger print sensor is the best ever ,which is super fast! And not to forget the camera quality is truly amazing... Excellent and vibrant image quality... Just addicted to the red back and the phones performance!!!!!"
185,5,Wonderful,"The product is good it’s a handy phone with smooth display and awesome look ,camera and performance everything is quite cool the only draw back is battery it takes more time to charge post 80% but drains fast yet lasts for 9 hrs as of my knowledge and usage. Definitely worth buying this awesome good one but spending this huge amount on this is a thinkable one as the design is normal and old. But when coming to performance and display far better than 11 until my knowledge. It’s up to you who choose this good one 😉"
186,5,Brilliant,"Mobile performance, camera and display as its peaks. But battery is draining so fast. Who wants stands apple compact mobile go for it. Before this one I was using LG G7 think, I feel like screen is large on my hands that’s why I searched for small screen compact mobiles. In that process I came across this compact beast. I took this one because of screen size. But apple didn’t disappoint my decision except battery.✌️👍"
187,4,Does its job,"I have been an android user since last 10 years and recently switched from my Samsung Galaxy S7 ( which I was using since 4 years) to the iPhone SE 2020 .
The phone is perfectly sized . It feels comfortable in my hands and in my pants( pocket) .It is sleek, thin and looks good . I am used to the big bezels.
The camera is good . I have been stuck at home and I shoot random stuff at my home and the camera has delivered well . The videos are better .Very clear , stable.
The performance is top notch . It’s been just a week and few days and it’s been a smooth ride
The battery life is fine by my standards. I charge in the evening every day to 100% and I am left with 20-30 % after 24 hours when I put my phone to charge again.
The charging however is slow. It takes more than 2 hrs to charge from 25-100% . I do not charge the phone overnight.I do not play any games on my phone but I use it for email,texting , phone calls (about an hour a day max) occasional camera usage, and a lot of YouTube .Screen time per day is around 2.5 to 3 hours.
The call quality is good. Voice on both ends is clear and the speakers are clear and loud.
WiFi reception has been good and have not noticed any issues
The iOS experience has been good so far . So far, I have not been limited by any of the software features . I could do everything that I used to on my android phone. The apps and overall experience is similar to what I was getting on my android

Overall, the phone is a good buy and I hope it lasts me for a few years"
188,5,Classy product,"The phone is too good. The performance is excellent, the camera is the best. This is my first iphone and it's great, the battery is also more than enough and what I like the most is it's size, it is sufficient, not too less. The only downside that I feel this phone has is the battery runs out like anything when you are on call, rest the phone is a beast and an added advantage was that due to it's small battery, my screen time got reduced ;)"
189,4,Good quality product,"replaced SE with my iphone 7
more or less the same size and display
white color looks amazing and apple designed SE in line with iphone 11 and above models so it looks so damn pretty!!!
if looking for compact size plus preferring touch id over face id then choose SE over XR(both are somewhat of the same range).
XR is bulky and bigger with better battery performance (and face id ofcourse) so make your choice accordingly
i hardly use my phone so cant say much about the battery life(i have to charge post 24hrs since use is bare minimum)
its been a month since i purchased it and loving it(mostly the same as my previous iphone 7)"
190,5,The first affordable iPhone,"Apple surely delivered a product whose price is finally at-par with other state-of-the-art smartphone brands. The processor and speed are amazing with zero lag. iOS experience is quite pleasing after switching from Android. The external sound is terrific and one of the best a smartphone has to offer. Touch and display are beyond expectations. Overall feel is quite good and the bezels don't really affect much. The only downside is the camera and battery. Both are modest at best. With reasonable use, you can spend a day with the battery life."
191,4,Wonderful,"The performance iss as expected great, the battery life is not actually a concern, but be sure to buy a 18w charger cause the charging speed from the given 5w adapter is soo sloow , likee really nerve cracking sloww. Buy a apple certified charger from anker or beikin or for cost saving go with mi 18w chrager, with 18w charging as the battery is small in capacity but effective it charges fast enough just charge for 30 mins when phone is still with 20% left and you could get near to 80 ,. Im a power user i got screen on time of 4 ½ hours , 1½ hour gaming, 2 surfing through web and 1 hour of surfing through Flipkart as this os the festive season.
Camera is good enough for the price don't expect flagship level performance, as i came from pixel 2xl the camera experience is little downgrade for me.
Speakers are great the quality is top notch just like iphone 11 or 11 pros,
Go for this if you want a sleek small and effective iphone which does all the things we want perfectly without any enthusiastic features,
And bye the way ios 14 update is soo cool .
You can buy this even for the mrp of the phone without hesitation ."
192,5,Doesn't feel like carrying a BRICK!!,"Alright, lets first address the elephant in the room, the battery life. Yes it sucks. Barely lasts me a workday. Oh and another thing, Truecaller doesn't work well with iOS due to all that security.

Everything else is great. The OIS in video is just amazing.

I was looking for a small smartphone that can be operated by one hand. That felt like a phone and not like carrying a piece of brick in your pocket. I don't mind the bezels, physical fingerprint reader is so much better than on screen reader to this day. As for those folks running after megapixels, a 12 MP Apple camera gives the same image quality as a 108 MP Mi camera. Not a Apple fanboy, speaking from practical experiences."
193,5,Great product,"One word, Outstanding!

I’ve Samsung galaxy A70 and I turned off many of its services including animations so that it give me a all day battery life but this is not the case with this iPhone SE .

It comes with just 1821 mah battery but trust me It gives 24hr battery backup which includes 4.5hr on screen time.
Mostly I use my phone for WhatsApp, insta, news articles, YouTube music and puzzle games when I got time.

It’s display is good, looks like OLED one (but it is not)."
194,5,Perfect product!,"First of all very premium and beautiful phone,so cool, handy, stylish, awesome thank u apple.
I have heard about the battery backup but being so low Mah battery apple is giving you the quality which easily runs for a day with more than average use.
Function is so smooth u r gonna luv this.
Camera quality is a little bit low but over all can compromise.
Sound quality is so good clean and strong.
Size is small but it's up to you as company is telling it in description, I personally feel it preferable as a handy phone.
It's a budget quality phone thanks apple."
195,5,Mind-blowing purchase,I think who uses iPhone or who wants to start using iPhone should buy this little beautiful phone. I'm moved by iPhone cleanliness and fantastic user interface. I've become quite fan of Apple Ecosystem so don't listen to me. Try it yourself. I'm sure you'd love it.
196,5,Must buy!,I strongly recommend this phone to people who is more work oriented. Game loves should skip this phone as this is not a game phone. Best features with stunning looks & performance. Mobile is very handy with 4.7 inch screen. Packed with good performances and nice camera. This is my first iPhone. Very good experience with Apple. Battery performance is good but not excellent. After 100% charged I have used 27 hrs. after using Calls/Mails/Social Media etc.
197,5,Terrific,Best budget compact iphone... OS is smooth as always.. and its powerful with the processor... if you can compromise the OLED display this is a great one to buy. Camera is decent enough
198,4,Good choice,This is my first Apple product and I was mesmerised by its fast processor and amazing display features such as Video quality in 4K facet. There is a shortcoming though with regards to the screen size but it can be Come in handy too if you change your perspective. I have played rockstar games on this phone and the graphics were awesome. A must buy 😇
199,5,Fabulous!,Good budget phone by Apple in 31K. Camera quality is good .Battery life sufficient if you are a moderate user .Performance is awesome .
200,5,Best upgrade for previous SE users - performance and battery,"I have used it for more than a month now. First of all its a great product for those who prefer hardware and compactness over design or the latest camera features.
Definitely a great upgrade for previous SE users.(I am one)
1) performance - hands down the best chip u could get
2) battery - for previous see users this will be a grad one I actually get 7-8 hours of screen time with a little bit of gaming. So will definitely last a day for normal usage.
For those who might have used recent devices of apple/android might not like the backup.
3) camera - hands-down again in normal aspects and but u won't be having the latest multi-camera features. I click very rarely so no problem for me."
201,4,Value-for-money,"Camera : It has very impressive camera, really shines in day light and outdoor conditions. For low light scenarios it is better to keep your phone in pocket.(i hope they provide night mode in future).
Display : The display is decent (the phots from camera on this display looks Okish but they look awesome on transferring to PC and viewing them on Better display)
Performance : works like charm. Nothing beats it, throw any game at it and it will run them without any degradation in performance.
Battery: most disappointing part of this device is its battery. It gives almost 5.5 hours of screen on time on casual use. You can’t play games on this battery without putting it on charge(max 2.5 hrs of pubg). Heavy users should consider buying XR or lighting extension for simultaneous charging and earpods.
The wireless charging is very convenient."
202,5,Super!,"Very nice phone with compact phone factor, price is little bit more , but i got this on 36649rs. Battery is not too bad, if u are not hardcore hame, all over very nice phone with super fast processor"
203,5,Just wow!,"A phone only for selected people for size and handy use and dual sim requirement or else you can go for other models

Very fast delivery thank you Flipkart and seller New brand pack sealed price recorded unboxing video all things ok warranty ok buying MI wireless power bank having wireless charging and fast charging also"
204,5,Simply awesome,"Wonderful camera
Brilliant speed
Good battery life of 6 hours continues usage... better than iPhone 7 and iPhone 8
Overall go for it.. it’s best iPhone you can get at this price."
205,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"The iphone SE performs in a great way when it comes to camera quality and it's Speed. The camera captures stunning images and the pictures come out to be very natural. The camera can be easily compared with the likes of iPhone xs series and 11 series . The phone is very swift and performs all the tasks very smoothly. The only concern about this phone is the battery performance. The battery drains out quickly as compared to other iphones. It could be because of the very
powerful processor and low mah battery. Although iPhones have a great reputation of RAM management and battery optimisation, but this is not the case in iPhone SE.
Overall it's a good buy who wants to have a powerful processor and can also compromise on the screen size.
Due to the small screen this phone is very comfortable to hold and easily fits into the pocket. But you have to compromise with the screen size as now a days many prefer to have a big screen size phones for media consumption and other routine tasks.
If you want to be in the apple ecosystem and can live with the average battery and small screen size then you can definitely go for it."
206,5,Fabulous!,"Hi,

The iphone SE 2020 128 GB phone is amazing

The screen size is 4.7 inches which is the best and ideal size for an apple cell phone

IOS 13 is Super, phone speed is therefore Super, voice clarity is fantastic, Retina display again Super

Value for money at 47k and go for the 128gb model.

All the best


Biswanath Sengupta"
207,5,Super!,The phone is super fast. The phone is the right size on my hand. Camera is good but not the best but still clicks good enough pictures. Battery life is bad
208,5,Great product,"Wonderful phone...
I am typical fan of iphone SE. My previous phone iphone SE 1 is also worked we well over the period. I find this one perfect for me due its size 4.7'. Most of people will not like due to small screen but it's extremely powerful.

Camera
Wonderful portrait mode for selfie & main camera.

Bottom line
""Chota packate bada dhamaka"""
209,5,Highly recommended,"At this price it is the best iPhone for an Apple lover.
Device is handy, powerful in performance and value for money. In today’s time of large screen phablets iPhone SE is the best device type you can go for. Only go for it if you do not large screen phone.


Camera is not bad, descent 12MP Shooter
TouchId on the iPhone is the best
Screen and brightness is appropriate
Front shooter is nice
Only thing that I dislike is battery
You would love the Processing of A13 bionic chip"
210,5,Simply awesome,"Best compact phone ,camera is excellent
Battery is average
Display is very nice
Performance is a power house🔥🔥🔥"
211,4,Worth the money,"Pros :
Compact design
Display
Camera
Sound

Cons :
Performance decreases after a month use, lags observed.
No charger/adapter
Tough to use keyboard/type due to compact size(but great in every other sense)
Battery doesn't last even for 24hrs for normal usage.. My observations(Instagram,YouTube, Whatsapp, Calls) if only for this then expect around 18-20hrs... If gaming then expect less than 10hrs..

Heats up when charging..!!!

Nothing is perfect, buy it only if u r a normal user else consider other option tbh..!!"
212,5,Excellent,"One of the best thing about this phone is its Apple A13 Bionic processor speed. You can buy a phone with 20000/- of another brand with high RAM capacity but no one focuses on processor benchmark number. Lightning speed in a small pack of phone is very satisfying and really good for working people who want to make a fast call, want to check WhatsApp quickly etc. The camera is also very good for the given specs and takes video with 4K resolution.

I highly recommend this phone for people who are very busy with a full-day work schedule and need to check emails, WhatsApp, messages, make calls quickly etc. Games should keep themselves away from this."
213,5,Awesome,"Bought it because I wanted a small phone with all features. After five months of usage, I find this phone to be a power packed super horse.

Very fast processing, no lags whatsoever.

Decent battery backup. With a total screen time of about 4 hrs a day with Bluetooth, WiFi, dual sim and location always on, the battery lasts a full day.

Easily fits into the hand. Upper bezel could have been shorter to make it more smaller. Best option for people like me who don’t like big screen phones.

Touch, fingerprint sensor, gps, compass all work very smooth without any glitches.

An awesome choice."
214,4,Worth the money,"Battery draining very fast comparing with XR .. Also gets heated with basic uses like calling in loudspeaker, youtube browsing etc.. Otherwise good in quality and speed.. but not worthy for the price 42500. Bought it for the reason of its small size.."
215,5,Worth every penny,"Thumbs up to this new product from apple,just love to hold it from one hand,perfomance and camera quality is just legit in this device.It is made for the people who like the old design of apple products and prefer pne hand use.Battery performance is also decent in this product thanks to that A13 chip.Worth buying this product,i am satisfied."
216,5,Just wow!,This is my first IPhone. I am really happy with this purchase. The camera quality is nice. The performance is amazing. The battery life is sufficiently good. It comes with tons of amazing features. This product was released at the right time when I broke my phone. And I am really happy that iPhone came up with a budget flagship.
217,5,Super!,"After using iPhone 5s, 6, 6s, 8 and Xr I think I am qualified enough to say that this phone is the best value for money iPhone has ever launched. The processor is super fast, there are not a host of features on offer, but whatever has been provided is top notch. This phone is certainly for those who are not looking for big size phones, which is the trend nowadays."
218,5,Super!,Another wonderful product from apple and am amazing fast delivery by Flipkart during these lockdown days. Thanks for bringing it so fast to us after launch.
219,5,Awesome,Compact mobile with all the smart features.fed up with big screen mobles. And this made things better. I can rate camara quality to 5+ it is soo good
220,5,Great product,I simply loved the phone and honestly this size is perfect for me!! Though honestly speaking the battery is not so good but yes if you’re not a heavy user it’s not a big deal however the video quality is superb and it always feels premium to even use it!!! So if you are looking for something cheap but useful go for this! It’s worth that money except for the battery but I have a fast charger so it charges quickly!
221,5,Simple phone with powerful processor,"My expectations for a mobile phone were simple: 1) Need to have good call clarity 2) Should be handy 3) Good enough camera quality to capture memories 4) The battery should last at least 2 days.

In this quest, the best fit i found was Redmi 2 Prime mobile, it had all things matching. Later the mobile boom was phenomenal that all the points except Point ""2) Should be handy"" were met. The screen size of phones have increased manifold. My quest for handy had very few models if brand is also a criteria. The last handy mobile phone which was handy i had was Redmi 7a! To get a handy phone in Android was such a pain. I need to go for a lower configuration mobile phone to match the handy criteria.

On the other side, most of the Apple phones 6s, 7, 8 were too apt for the handy part! But, the battery was always an issue. Since, it was very much evident that Android phone makers are not going to consider the niche ""handy"" fans, went ahead and bought iPhone SE.

Im using it for 3 weeks now. As mentioned earlier my use and expectations are minimal, iPhone SE outperformed all my expectations. The battery comes easily for 2 days with regular calls and WhatsApp usage. Even if the charge reduces, the battery gets charged from 19% to 70% ~ 10 mins with stock charger. Camera quality is very good. Camera has so many options, I didn't explore much. One important thing i liked is the ability to use Google Account to use favorite Google Apps in iOS. And iOS provides option to the user to let the user choose how an App should use location or other personal settings. In my experience these things can be controlled in Android as well, but Android won't push much for privacy.

All in all a good purchase, though the price is on the higher side."
222,5,Perfect product!,"It is the best product ever with great processer from iPhone at such a low price, if you like small phone with small display you should definitely buy it."
223,5,Perfect product!,"A good phone for ladies according to the size. Compact and handy with a lot of powerful features.
Best camera, classic look, powerful processor and of course an Apple product which is a style statement.
Battery is very good. Efficient for 1 day usage. Don't go with the negative reviews, just experience the iPhone. Worth it."
224,4,Delightful,"A very great phone for the price. I got it for 24,000 in the sale. The delivery was on time, the box was not at all damaged. A genuine product from apple and flipkart. Only issue is the battery backup but pther than that, the phone is a complete beast!
Camera quality is superb with a tough design.
Must buy!"
225,5,Awesome,"This phone keeps up its promise.
One day battery life (last from 7 AM to 12 midnight under medium to high usage)
Best camera
Best performance, better than flagship android phones.
Good display (i.e. perfectly done LCD display )
Good audio quality
Best network chipset awesome network reception
Really a good buy, if anyone who reads this review has an idea about Oneplus Nord means here is my suggestion please don’t buy it.
iPhone SE 2020 returns the most value for what we pay. Oneplus Nord is not a good choice."
226,3,Just okay,"The phone is great and has snappy performance. Ofcourse iOS in itself is one of the most refined OS in the world(Android has too much fragmentation, app developers cant keep up, also Android Auto is super laggy too). Apple CarPlay works like a charm in my car. For anyone wanting to try an iPhone this is a great entry level phone.
Yes there are downsides to this phone. Namely screen and battery. I also own a Samsung Note 8, so the difference in screen resolution is evident. Note 8 has a SUPER AMOLED screen. For a 40k phone I think apple could have included a better display. Atleast a 1080p display.
Also battery is not the best on this one as compared to other iPhones. I have less issues since I am mostly at home or in my car and both places have access to a charging point. But people out on a field job will face the scarcity.

Also one huge huge downside. I am also an iOS developer. I have the latest 2020 16"" Macbook pro. But surprise surprise, you can't connect your latest iPhone to the latest Macbook out of the box. Apple it wouldn't hurt to include a USB A to USB C converter out of the box. Even Samsung does that. Luckily I was able to use my Note 8's converter, but I assume not everyone is that lucky all the time."
227,5,Brilliant,Great Phone for Great Price... Blazing fast . Good camera. Small and Handy. Love it !!!
228,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"iPhone se is a very good phone to purchase.
The camera is very good. And for the performance., no words to say. A13 is much powerful than any other processors.
Great performance and decent premium look.
Battery backup is good enough. It will last for a whole day.

Best budget iPhone till date."
229,4,Nice product,"I am ISO user since last 5 years and upgraded with iPhone 5s>iPhone 6s>iPhone SE. I am highly satisfied with the product and features. Chip 13 gives me amazing results and experience. Battery is not an issue for me. I like the size 4.7 the most. I am happy with my product so far. Thank you Apple and Flipkart.

Suggest to sell iPhones assembled in India to support Aatmanirbharbharat mission."
230,5,Classy product,"Switching from Android to Ios was a fear to me initially, but after the purchase of this mobile all my misconceptions are shattered.

Likes:
1. The form factor(size) : Neither too small nor too large, very good ergonomic light weight stunning design
2. Colour: Mine is red and very attractive in the real world also a sure shoot head turner, my next preferred colour in order would be white and black
3. Processing Power: Be it heavy games like PUBG, Call of duty, Asphalt 9 or heavy image and video editors like Canva and Adobe run with breeze like charm Thanks to IOS and A13
4. Camera: Way better than all the Android Cameras out there in this budget range my next best liked photo camera after Nokia
5. Network reception: 4g volte on dual sim and Wifi6 technology gives me advantage than my peers in better and fast connectivity
6. Wireless Charging and Waterproof features

Areas if improvement:
1. Need a fast charger to be shipped in the box instead of the standard one so the charging time can be reduced by 30%
2. More colours like yellow, cyan, greens would be welcomed

Myth bursted: Battery life easily last for about 8 hrs with heavy usage, 12 hrs on medium usage and 18 plus hours with basic usage as per my personal usage since past 4 days on different usage patterns

My personal suggestion: Go for the 128 Gb and above models if you have littles more more available at disposal as the 4k video recordings, Games, Apps, Movies downloaded on streams services like Prime, Netflix etc would not be a problem after 6-9 months of usage when you will find a need for extra space"
231,5,Must buy!,"If you are planning to get one, don't think too much

Switching from android to ios was like a huge change

Battery - 4/5 the battery lasts approx 10-12 hrs on normal usage

Camera - 5/5 trust me the dynamic range, color saturation everything is too good in this phone

Performance - 5/5 even though RAM is only 3 GB but still it is coupled with A13 3rd gen bionic chip which is too good

The phone is light weight, compact durable as i wanted

I might take 2-3 days to get used to the UI because i still drag the notification bar to turn on wifi XD

Overall the phone is 4.5/5 just don't think too much, go for it!"
232,5,Awesome,"It’s a great phone. I bought two phones for my parents. Now our entire family is under Apple Ecosystem, using every Apple products available in India. iPhone SE is same size like iPhone 7/8. Super smooth. Battery lasts for a day for sure with modestly heavy use. Screen is brighter than older versions of iPhones (6 or 7 or 8). Photos really good, natural. All the features of iPhone 11 put inside camera.

Rest like multiple personal or office mails, synchronisation with Apple TVs, Apple Watch or AirPods or even with iPads and HomePods like breeze. All social networking apps, home app (if you’ve power control setups at home), Apple TV+, AirDrop, Family Sharing, Find My, Notes, Reminders, Shortcuts (even if you’ve complex algorithms) works fluidic, just like gliding. Apple Music, Siri, though can be improved a lot, works fine with home app and homepods with controls from iPhone SE. Typing in Apple TV with apple remote (download apple remote) with iPhone SE is like cakewalk. Siri can even speak Hindi but Bengali not supported yet. My octogenarian parents are loving it.

Not much difference in layouts or functionality if you’re already using Apple Phone, must upgrade if you’ve iPhone 6 or earlier but definitely much much better if you’re migrating from Android. Migration from Android is like super easy and you’ll not lose a single piece of your docs or photos or texts or contacts in any third party app.

iPhone is a must buy and would recommend to buy it from Flipkart availing offers.

Flipkart delivery is very fast and packaging as usual good"
233,5,Super!,"I class phone by apple ..
Very compact and powerful
The camera is very powerful and latest ios is also very handy
Overall a worth purchase"
234,3,Does the job,"Build - Excellent (4/5)
Display - Good (3/5)
Sound quality - Excellent (4/5)
Camera (image) - Okay (2.5/5)
Camera (Video) - Very good (3.5/5) (a little bit jitters are there and video is not so sharp)
Call quality -Very good (3.5/5)
Battery - Bad (not too bad) (2/5) (just blink your eye and 1% is gone)

Very disappointed that they is no charger and headset bundled with the box. I don't consider this a value for money mobile."
235,5,Just wow!,"I have been using the iPhone se 2020 for close to a week now and I am super happy with the experience. As you might have seen in multiple reviews of the device, the battery life is a setback. But the battery easily lasts for a day with a good amount of gaming and video streaming and that works for a user like me."
236,5,Brilliant,"Phone is great for a minimal user like me. Good performance, great camera and very handy!"
237,5,Fabulous!,Specially for them Who are new to the apple e o system.. Performance and other stuffs all good.. Camera preety good.. Battery seems okey if you’re not a game lover.. Overall Good in this price segment.. If you can Maintain it properly it easily lasts as it is for next 5-6 years if you chnge this battery after 2.5-3 yrs..
238,5,Just wow!,"Keeping it short
Best value for money, capeesh. Has its shortcomings battery(will get you 3.5 - 5.5 hours of screen on time depending on the usage, gaming is wonderful but due to its small battery capacity it does depletes fast, roughly around 2 - 2.5 hours on screen time) and camera(night mode doesn’t support, although Apple can add it through software on due to its processing power but lack in a second camera don’t let it do so). Other then that trust me you will enjoy it and get its money’s worth. Since I am already in the Apple ecosystem of its variety of product’s, the flexibility of moving device to device without hampering my work flow does have a advantage over its android counter parts; this is coming from a guy who has his whole life used android and windows as its primary os and has hands on both on phone and tablet segments."
239,5,Perfect product!,"The phone is all over amazing best for entering ios ecosystem the screen size is not as small as it may seem , the only problem i faced was battery life it could have been better but the powerful processor does demand a lot of battery , the images are unbeatable even by Android flagships"
240,5,Classy product,"Superb phone

Its Handy and looks good

Performance is too good

Camera is Also good"
241,5,Perfect product!,"This is my second iPhone and it’s pretty good, the performance is fast and never felt a lag. For my day-to-day usage it’s perfect, I have no complaints with the battery. The compact size makes it easier to use and for this budget it’s worth to go for unless want to shell out 2x the amount for 12 mini, which is a bit smaller than SE 2nd Generation; has better camera setup; better screen & better battery life."
242,4,Nice product,"The best compact phone you can get along with fingerprint scanner.. The classic iphone design.. So clean and premium looks.. I guess the most premium looking classic iphone with a powerful flagship processor ( except the notched iphones X and beyond).. Go for it . You won't regret if you like small phones.. Feels great to hold and easy to use with one hand... For almost a year and half , i felt like I was carrying a tablet in my pocket when using 6.5 inch phone..I feel liberated now with a top of the line small phone.. No manufacturer makes small phones with this quality these days.."

244,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"Just bought this phone a week ago. Already loving the performance,camera.
Also my usage is not much (no games)and the battery easily lasts for about 10 to 11 hours
Anyone who loves compact phone you should go for this phone"
245,5,Terrific purchase,"Writing this review post 3 months of usage.
For normal user and daily tasks battery is decent and will work from morning full to evening.
One who is looking for compact phone and moving to iPhone , this is a good choice.
For high usage people and gaming, not at all recommended because of smaller battery and screen size."
246,4,Good quality product,"The Phone makes it a good compact phone to kick start you ios Experience. This being my second iphone after the 6S+ and this phone just being my secondary phone it has the solid reliability which i want. The battery standby is good but if a person in considering to use this phone as a primary device the battery wont last for the full day sadly. The performance is brilliant, no lags in the phone and camera is pretty solid in 2021 and can definitely see the camera hold up pretty good for another year or even two. The speakers are pretty nice and they are dual speakers for your info. Overall this phone is a worth purchase for the processor it packs inside and the worthy single camera"
247,5,Perfect product!,Not just the best value for money iPhone but the best value for money phone. Got it for 30k. Best phone if you are a light user.

260,4,Wonderful,Everything seems fine with this phone but this is a super fast car but with a small gas tank the one and only con of this phone but if you are looking to buy this phone you know what you have signed up for but if you want to get a scoop of ios for the first this will be a perfect device to start with as it comes with the one of the best processor at an reasonable price tag my suggestion is that if you can compromise by charging your phone for 2 times a day you can easily go for it
261,4,Very Good,Overall the phone is very good but the fact is that it is too small in comparison to phones now these days however the camera is very good and the processor is very powerful you can play any game in the in it. You should not consider buying this. Only con is that it is screen sizes too small.
262,4,Really Nice,Product is very good and a very good value for money. Just loving it the most. One of the best phones for this price.
263,5,Excellent,"Worth buying. I bought for 37000 that to on installments. 4K recording is awesome and camera is excellent, sleek, beautifully designed, battery is being improved a lot.
A great package, those want handy phone se2 is perfect for them. Used quite brands but the quality of photos and video on iPhone is exactly what we see or click or shoot."
264,3,Does the job,"This phone fells like alto car with SUV engine. If you fill it full and go for a ride, it would get empty the moment you start to enjoy the ride.

Not worth the money."
265,5,Excellent,"Don't Hesitate to buy. This is the best Compact smartphone till date.
People will tell you myths about battery life.
But believe me battery life is very good for Average use (around 7 hours)

Buy if you -
1. like small sized phones
2. want best performance
3. camera
4. budget high performing phone.

Don't buy if you are -
1. gamer
2. very heavy user."
266,5,Great product,I buyed it in Dasara sale at 24999/- as per I spend I bought a very very nice phone.Below 28000 it is a best compatible phone.
267,4,Worth the money,"Best apple phone under 33000. Best value for money I phone. Average battery not much lower as all are talking. Will easily last a day for normal users.The speaker quality is very good, best stereo speakers under 40000. Go for it without any doubt."
268,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"If you want use it as a dual sim , SE supports a one physical sim and a E sim , currently Airtel and reliance supports e sim . We will get a QR code which can be scanned and e sim will be activated. If you where a android user and want to get the contacts in google account , there is option in setting account - mail - add accounts - add your google account here and select option for contacts . Hope this help ."
269,5,Worth every penny,"I was looking for a compact and slim phone with a finger print sensor on the front. The design is dated, but the pros that I was looking for was all there. I love this form factor. What impressed me was the ease with which it multi tasks. I am a first time apple user and this kinda was a wake up call for me. The ui is good, the device is really fast and more importantly my office apps works like a charm (I struggled a bit with android before with the certificates). I feel it is worth the buy."
270,4,Delightful,Trust your gut and buy this if you are not a heavy user battery is a little shaky specially not meant for gaming where a battery drops up to 10% after every PUBG or Fortnite match the phone and also day to day task very well. Supports fast charging which is a great feature if you buy a separate 18 W charger. Works great and handles every app very well still unfortunately there are very less apps that are supported by iOS and android.
271,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"I love apple products
I start using iphone from Iphone 4
I used Iphone 4,4S,5,5S,Se 1st gen,6S and XR now Iphone Se2
i missed using iphone 7, 8 so i love this size, in xr i face the difficulty is face lock actually face recognition is superb but the thing is during this covid situations we people are using masks so it’s difficult to type passwords
in this new gen iphone se i really happy to hear that fingerprint is back.
coming to performance its really amazing.
Back camera is awesome
Selfie cam is also ok

if we people want a compact design i recommend Iphone SE"
272,5,Highly recommended,"An apple product worth the price, i always used to find apple exorbitant luxury but this one fits the bill and in that price you are getting to use an high end apple product. Also i love the small size fits right in the pocket and hand much better than carrying a tablet sized phone"
273,5,Simply awesome,"Using I phone 6s from 4year and upgraded to SE 2020
Screen size is similar to 6S but feels more plush, speed is superb absolute no lag,
I feel size of the phone is pretty decent for daily usage purpose,
Battery life is also better one charge last long for a day,

Overall value for money phone."
274,4,Good choice,"I have used iPhone 5s, 7 and my last phone was 11 pro. I wanted something smaller, so decided to go with this.
Pros -
Compact and premium.
Insanely fast.
Display is crisp and color accurate.
Lightweight (11 pro was heavy)
Battery is good, 4-6 hours of screen on time depending on the tasks.
Wireless charging and water resistance.

Cons

Not having an amoled screen.
Fragile glass body.
No Night mode.

It's perfect for digital minimalists, If you don't want to spend all your time on your phone.
(Got the white 128 gb for 42k)"
275,5,A ideal upgrade for iPhone6s and its predecessors,"Would recommend this mobile if you are the one who doesn't play many games, uses mobile for surfing/social media and occasionally for photography. Would not recommend if you are into huge screens and brighter displays. To sum up, iPhone SE is a 'no-nonsense mobile' with an average camera and battery life. Also highlighting its significance, I can say it is DAMN FAST, you will be amazed by its speed and fluidity which makes it worthy enough for the money."
276,4,Wonderful,"iPhone user since 5 years.
Performance wise very nice phone and sufficient as per my basic requirement.
Secured device as compare to Android and compatible and very handy.
Bit disappoint in terms of battery performance.
12MP camera is fine for phone purpose."
277,5,Great product,This is my first iPhone and I am pretty happy with the device. Everything is okay with the phone but it would be much more better if it came with a bigger display and a higher mah battery
278,5,Highly recommended,"It cant get any better.
For people who like compact phones like 6,6s, nd 7 this is the real deal and way cheaper. My last phone was iphone 7 for 60k back in 2016 nd this is next generation 7 at just 38,900
Just amazing.. Performance is outstanding.."
279,5,Perfect product!,"this phone is great, if someone like small size phone then its great product for him.
performance is awesome really loved this apple product and also budget phone by apple."
280,4,Very Good,"Awesome phone the only drawback is its battery life, did not last entire day even with moderate usage. Camera is amazing and A13 is awesome, lighting fast phone with decent screensize. Not recommended for gamers, professionals and moderate users should go for it."
281,5,Excellent,"there,s nothing fancy in this phone, it,s simple and i love it... if you like compact and doesnt care much about battery, then go for it, A13 bionic chipset is waiting for you.
it,s not phone for everyone, but if you regret after buying it, it will show that you haven't researched about the phone.."
282,5,Wonderful,"Absolute beast of a phone - compact, portable and with an amazing camera paired to stereo speakers! Battery life is sadly the major drawback of this phone and so not recommended for people who expect higher screen on time. I find it suitable for our mothers and fathers who want something portable and easy to use from day one! I also found outdoor brightness of the screen underwhelming, struggling to read outdoors. But the phone makes up for its drawbacks for features such as: water and dust resistance, wireless charging, great camera, loud stereo speakers, fast processor, assured software updates for the next 5 years and dual sim capabilities."
283,5,A Super Affordable Smart Phone !!,"A perfect blend of nostalgia, perfect size and ergonomics combined with super top of the line specs but with some back dates stuff !
Overall, a value for money Apple phone which will last you another 3-4 years, maybe more and will never let you down.
Battery is a bit on the weaker side but with a 100% charge it will last you a bit more than a full day with normal to regular usage ( including phone calls,video calls, Youtube, OTT platforms, Social Networking sites and Camera. )
Games play smooth as butter but obviously the battery will drain.
This is a good budget iPhone and I love it !! :) :)"
284,5,Worth every penny,"Pros:
Very good performance
Photo and video taking capabilities in good light is excellent
Build quality
Cons:
Lower battery capacity than older models such as Xr
No lightning to aux convertor in box
Low light photos are very bad
Other:
Though the display specs are not top of the line it does meet the expectations. Sound quality is decent and does not disappoint.

Finally:
The phone gives good value for your bucks. In my opinion it is a must buy if you want to try an iPhone for the first time or want a iphone in the cheaper segment without compromising on most features."
285,5,Highly recommended,"Hey guys,
This my take on the iphone se. I purchased this phone for my mom, basically she needed a compact phone and who would have thought it would be an iphone.
Yes I do believe price is currently on higher side in india as compared to global market. But thanks to exchange and credit card offer I got it for 34k which I believe is a good deal.
Coming to the pros and cons
Pro
Compact size
Handles the apps very well thanks to A13 chipset.
Display is overall good same as that one iphone 7.
In terms of design and looks it's ditto as iphone 7.
Cons
Only con I felt is the battery. It discharges quickly and doesn't last a day. Also just a 5watt charger takes a long to charge on an average 2hrs.
It does support wireless charging but you need to spend additional for it.
Also I am currently charging it with my ipad charger which is 10watt charger and it takes 1hr to charge completely.
U can reduce the time by buying the 18watt charger as in the case of mine I am happy with the 10watt charger.

Overall I am happy with the purchase so is my mom.

Note- This ain't a device for someone coming from iphone 7 or later because it feels outdated from looks, design and display in today's era.
Recommended to buy it only if your tight on budget or desperately need your first iphone.

Regards"
286,4,Pretty good,"Phone is good if ypu wish t ahift drom android and want a decent camera in your pocket. Defenetly not for gamers because processor Bionic A13 can take nay game with full graphics no prob but battery will disappoint you. Not for long video calls rest things are fine premium feel full display could have been better.

If battery and display is also important ro you consider XR or 11."
287,4,Delightful,"Package is well packed . Got this phone in first sale itself and it's been 3 weeks . Performance is snappy and camera is pretty good. The only con is Battery life which barely lasts full day with moderate to heavy usage, but it is expected because of it's compact and light weight design. Other than that phone is good and price should be at least 10k cheaper then only price to performance ratio can be justified"
288,5,Terrific purchase,I love this product and thanks to flipkart for a quick delivery that I didn’t expect that I got it before the delivery date that mention in the order list and i thank you to the delivery man that he took patience to wait till I paid the bill for this order. Once again thank you so much.
289,4,Good quality product,iPhone SE here in 2020 boom it’s powerful device low budget iPhone ever don’t go on price phone is packed with performance running on A13 Chip which makes apps run butter smooth camera is good borrowed from IPhone 11 battery is smaller bcoz of the size of phone but does your job speaker is quite loud every phone has pros and cons so we have to deal with it overall it’s good phone under budget go for it all three colour are amazing I have bought white
290,5,Awesome,"other than battery all ok still 1800 mah battery lasting for 11 hrs with 5 hr screen time is great , battery casing will be awaited from apple , great for small and handy design lovers, battery is not ok"
291,4,Pretty good,"The phone works just fine! Despite the negativity around the battery life (which is true, only if you want to want to play games).
Camera is nice, display with True Tone feels just right and the performance is spectacular! After 3 years with Android (Google Pixel 2 XL) it was time to head back to iOS. Nothing against Android, that was a brilliant phone too, but too big for me. (Personal choice).
I don’t play games or watch movies/videos for prolonged duration. So a big screen just felt like an overkill. With Apple coming out with SE and the specs on offer, I thought it was the right time to switch back!

Overall, apart from battery and maybe the top bezel, this phone is a no-nonsense phone.

Cheers!"
292,5,Terrific,"Performance is awesome with A13 bionic chip
Those who capture a lot of pics it’s a very good choice fir them... single camera but picture quality is giant....
Battery performance is little bit of weak.. doesn’t looks good.. for normal use it’s ok.. but those who are heavy user for them doesn’t look good....
Very handy phone with a premium look... but the bazzels one the screen looks old..
but overall it’s good to buy within this price range"
293,4,Value-for-money,"This phone is meant for niche market. Not for people who like screen size more than 5.5 or 6 inch. Was waiting for a product like this since long and now will experience this with the latest A13 bionic chip. Great buy for people who require smaller handy phones. Not for gaming purpose of course. You can buy a play station instead 😉.
Regards"
294,5,Worth every penny,Super compact fone for no nonsense users!!! Good speaker quality & super fast due to A13 buonic chip.
295,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"I just love this phone. This is my first iPhone and it is handy, fast and beautiful. This is great power in small package. It is working absolutely great."
296,5,Must buy!,"So after using the phone for 12 months straight here’s my long term review for this device -

First w the pros -
1) top notch performance
2) best phone if u wanna enter the apple ecosystem
3)premium feel
4) great cameras
5) can use it for 2-3 years straight because of the apple software the support
6)wireless charging/ fast charging compatibility
7)water resistant
Cons - 1)small display
2)huge bezel
3) battery life is v bad of this device
4)heats while using
5) no dedicated night mode but u can use an app that is available on the App Store for 400rs which can do wonders at the night time 🤩


In short if I conclude everything I can say if u wanna use this phone as your secondary device then go for it because the battery backup is not so good and u have to charge it 2 times a day minimum and I would suggest to buy a 20W charger w it ( I got 5w in box and ik u wont be getting it now )
But keep this in mind that the battery health will degrade faster w the 20w compare to the 5w.
Thank you 🤍
Some camera samples that may help y’all 👇🏻👇🏻"
297,5,Excellent,"The iPhone SE 2020 is the most valuable and attractive phone of 2020. Cuz of it’s pricing which is also having a great powerful A13 Bionic chipset. From past I am using this mobile, really I am not seen any lagging or issue regarding while using this smartphone. Cuz of Apple products are well optimised,least customised,it’s eco system,power and it’s design that’s why I love Apple products"
298,5,Awesome,"Bought and used this device for 24 hours. This is pretty good bargain for People who do phone calls and watch few videos. Battery holds good for a day if you don’t push it. Don’t fall for the battery drain and charge testing videos. Use a Samsung charger. It charges fast while not heating the phone.

Camera is awesome and you don’t have to be a pro to click some brilliant pictures and videos. You want an iPhone then go for it."
299,5,Mind-blowing purchase,The Apple IPhone SE has been an all time favorite for the family members due to its size and quality. I have been using the old model of SE from 2014 and now changed to 2020 SE model due to its quality and reliability. The phone is very much handy for small size hands and also have bigger screen than earlier version. The sound quality is improved by it's stereo speakers. The quality of camera is also enhanced for great pictures for life time experience. It came in different colors with sleek in size and quality display. Feel price worthy and satisfied...
300,5,Must buy!,"Just an amazing phone, the interface is great there is no lag, the battery backup is also decent, and the camera quality is amazing the phone feels really premium and high quality, best choice go for it. Try buying the one with the charger and the earpods to save money"
301,4,Pretty good,"I shifted from android to IOS, believe me the experience is good.
During the initial stages, it will be difficult for android users but once you get use to it you will enjoy using IOS.
Coming to the phone, it is a very good phone at this price compared to all other phones available at the same price.
The camera is really very good as compared to the other 50 megapixels cameras available in the market.
I am not a heavy user hence battery life is good for a day.
Also, the phone is not that big, it's light weight and can be operated with one hand.
Overall good phone go for it."
302,5,Classy product,"Honest Review after using for around 3 months and still using it as primary mobile.
Pros.
Amazing Camera
Speaker is just too good.
The fluidic interface of apple which feels so smooth while using it.
The earphones given along with mobile phone in-box is just superb.
Cons.
1. Screen size is bit small. You get used to it with time but when it feels awkward when you suddenly switch from some big screen phone to this.
2. Battery life is not too great. Although with normal usage, my phone lasts whole day. Still a bigger battery would make it a must-buy phone.
Overall, this is my first iPhone and am satisfied with it till now (touchwood). Good value for money( since I got it in Big Billion Day for 28k).
Go for it guys specially if you are switching from Android to iOS for the first time."
303,5,Simply awesome,"After using for a week, this phone is working really upto expectation. Bought in 33K for 128gb variant along with charger and earpods. If you want a powerful chip along with large storage space and also a touch of apple, then this is the phone. PS: Black looks amazing and classy when comes to Iphone"
304,5,Wonderful,"I bought this mobile as a replacement for my mother's age old iphone 5S, as she was stuck with IOS & single home button. I'm really surprised with its great performance and features. Felt like buying it for myself too. But its battery is not so great for working people. To sum it up, very good mobile for this price bracket."
305,4,Nice product,"Battery backup is good, using it for last 2 weeks and it works for 24 hours for me in moderate usage. Camera is better than most of high end Android phones. I dint like notch display thus went for this one and I like the phone more than IPhone X and 11.
I don’t like heavy and big size so it fits my need and performance is top notch."
306,5,Brilliant,"It’s everything i expected it to be. In a market where thick heavy and monster sized smartphones are ubiquitous, this is a life saver for people like me who just want a thin and light smartphone that’s also easy to hold with one hand without compromising on performance. I have a gripe with modern mid range phones that are packed with 4 cameras but still take awful photos. This phone takes good photos with the limited range of its single camera, and I much prefer this. As for the battery, it’s adequate for me since I am not a so called power user. Easily lasts a day."
307,5,Worth every penny,It's pretty good but battery decrease too fast nd a good product
308,5,Terrific,I purchased this iPhone for my dad because of his requirements of small sized phone with decent performance and capable camera. This is the ideal phone for these requirements. He is pretty satisfied with the phone. My only complaint is 5 W Charger. After all it's cost over 40k.
309,5,Excellent,"First off all what a fantastic delivery flipkart made. I ordered the phone on 9th July 5:20 PM. Received the the phone on 10th July 9 Am.
Now coming to the phone. Its already been reviewed by many tech reviewer nothing more to say.
Performance is great. Battery part is ok. As u have to compare the battery with iPhone 7 and 8. Not with XR or iPhone 11.
One thing I did not like was there were no first charger only 5 volt charger is packed.
Other then that it's a great purchase.
If it's your first IPhone then go for it u will not be disappointed."
310,5,Super!,"My first ever Apple product.
It's small, snappy, has Touch Id (Apple pioneered in it).
I am astonished as to how such a small phone can outstand every other phone.
Reasons to buy:
1. Camera (Don't get fooled coz of one lens)
2. Performance (A13 bionic chip)
3. Screen (Small and reachable by single hand)
4. Power packed features (4K-60fps, water resistant, A13 chip, more secure touch ID, wireless charging, quick charging)
5. Price
Cons:
1. Outdated look.
2. Battery is very small although it lasts a decent amount of time.
3. Display is HD.
4. There are other phones in the segment which have double the features.

Pro tip: Buy the 128Gb version as it is the sweet spot (5k extra than the 64Gb)"
311,5,Mind-blowing purchase,Fantastic product super fast speed no lags like android phones no advertisements fabulous response to touch good battery life there is this wrong saying that battery life is not good
312,5,Great product,"This is more of my legal first iPhone. Been using borrowed ones or sticking with android this whole time.
Coming from the world of android, my first word to describe iOS is “cool”. Bye bye heat issues from android phones. Believe me I tested this phone to enormous stress but still there’s no heat issues.
My old Samsung note 8 didn’t boil that much but my one plus did. And bye bye blotwares.
Regarding this phone, chick to carry. Enough screen space to read e-books, see movies.

But adding media to view is like going from chennai to Delhi and back.i hard tough time updating my PC and then get approved iTunes and get media stuff.

The ear phones are the best. But it’s better to get Spotify or Apple Music subscription. Apple Music though 99 per month is worth it.
Waiting for AirPods to pair up with.

Calls are impressive.
This is the phone for basic telephony.

And battery life, I felt draining was not like my old note8. But still not a marathon runner. This phone Holds more juice in standby than androids, I feel.

On the whole, it’s like a new cool luxury car to drive with. Have to see the performance in the long run."
313,5,Wonderful,"I have using iPhone XR except of the screen size
Every thing is great about this phone se 2020
Speak about battery it’s far better compare to iPhone 8
The new processor is helping a lot and fast enough
Small in size"
314,4,Wonderful,"This is my first apple phone, previously I was using OnePlus 3T.
Upgrading from android to IOS was a tough decision since I was getting the latest oneplus 8 in the same price range with offers.
However I stuck with my decision of upgrading to IOS since I have found that IOS technology is better than android phones.
Only CON with Apple is the battery. The battery runs out pretty fast.
Well that is something I miss, nothing else.
Great phone, slim and very fast. cheers!!"
315,5,Highly recommended,I would like to say only one thing iPhone rocks. The stereo sound quality is just at par with other phones in this range. Connect to your external HPs or soundbars and your are ready to rock and roll. Deep bass level are so clear u would fall in love with this. I really don’t mind bulky bezels because that is what makes this handy and your very own and personal phone. It’s a powerful beast in a small size. :)
316,5,Excellent,Tremendous purchase and awesome device . First of all it’s as per the latest lifestyle like 2 sim option and in a pocket size at such a great price. I am very happy and satisfied.
317,5,Perfect product!,"This is the best phone you can buy in this price.
With this #banchinaproducts moment, this is the best option.
I know this product is assembled in china but its a American product so I am satisfied.
Its a breakthrough of great performance and minimalist design."
318,5,Great product,It’s a great IPhone. Those who are using 6 and 6s should definitely upgrade. But those who are using 7 and above should not as 7 is still a fast phone and it will get atleast one more year of update. Coming to iPhone se it’s a great phone. Camera is great. Features are great. Battery is issue. It won’t last you whole day if your a heavy user. Expect 5 hours of screen time of your heavy user. Otherwise overall good value for money.
319,4,Very Good,"se Apple is good phone , quick delivery, good camera, handy, easily useable but without gst reverse bill . ipurchased this phone for my company but flipkart not give me gst reverse bill"
320,5,Awesome,"It's my first iphone
Very loud and good sound, that's the part that I enjoy the most, be it calls, music or movies...the sound is amazing. Nice display. Very smooth and fast, no lag obviously. Camera is good but not exceptional. The only con is the screen size, it has such a great gaming processor but I can't play coz of the screen size, the size also affects the camera resolution. The charger cable was faulty...so had to buy a boat charging cable."
321,5,Perfect product!,"This iphone totally worth it. I call it a Mini iphone 11. I suggest this to those who are 1. looking to buy apple product for the first time. 2. Looking for a phone that is compact but with full features of flagship. 3. Although it is good for gaming but I will not recommend you to consider it for gaming.

Only concern:- battery capacity is not that great but if you do moderate use with social media and bit of youtube streaming.It lasts for a day. 11-12 hours outside."
322,5,Love it,"Excellent phone. For budget-minded users, this SE version is about half the price of the iPhone 11 and is easily comparable in its operations, even using the latest A13 processor which is new in the 11. All said this is a great phone, very well worth the money, and a great deal from Flipkart...Kudos!!!"
323,4,Worth the money,"I used windows phone, android phone (Lenovo and Moto) and now this. I am not impressed more than my previous phone Moto X4 to this. Be it charging, ease of using. I got used to Moto actions so much that I unintentionally do the same operation here and then realise that I am no longer using Moto.

Since it is still a week when I started using iPhone would like to wait for a month to see to find the ease of use."
324,5,Brilliant,"I gifted it to my girlfriend she is very happy with it but it’s not for show off, people might make fun of you using this product, I’m thinking of buying 12 pro for her in sometime"
325,5,Awesome,"It is an awesome device, you get all the perfomance you need in this small form factor size. Display quality is good, camera is awesome (could have been better). The only disappointment is battery, you will get an average of 5 hours after full charge. If you are looking for a device with excellent perfomance in a small form factor and can compromise with the battery then this one is for you."
326,4,Excellent Specs Let Down/Throttled Only By Battery Life!,"I have been using the SE for a good 12-13 days now, have tried gaming but i won't recommend buying this phone for power and gaming as that would drain the battery faster. The primary reason i went with the SE is the form factor and smaller screen, I wanted to cut down on my digital consumption and this has helped me do that.

Pros:
Super Fast
Taptic Engine is amazing
Very Decent Camera
Great Build quality
Entry into Ios ecosystem
Solid 5 years Support

Cons:
No night mode
Average battery

For my usage (light-medium) i get around 5-6 hours of SOT (music and social media with a solid couple of hours of calls) anything more I guess will crush the battery to 0 sooner.

Overall a solid entry-level phone for newcomers to IOS"
327,3,Fair,"Ahhh where to start.!!, yes simple and daily usage mobile, one day battery life for normal usage. Great performance with A13 Bionic chip. Apple selling this mobile without technology, there is no great things to do, iPhone 8 with latest processor, if you can afford go for iPhone XR or iPhone 11, else go for one plus 8 series."
328,5,Super!,"The best phone after 5S. People who are into only basic features they must go for this phone. Value for money. Compact, handy and the best budget iPhone ever."
329,3,I expect this to be best but unfortunately last,"Design is awesome and one of the primary reason to buy. But build quality have compromised as in one month the back galss got scraches but its ok and vary from user to user.

Camara is best in this price but if you use it it eats battery like hell which I dont liked.

Gamming is also good but again eats battery not good If you play games more often you need to charge it.

In my opinion I am not happy as my usage remains same for old iPhone SE and new iPhone SE 2020. If you need a phone and you want it to be iphone go for Old SE. Both works same on moderate usage.

Use Clash of clains, Whatsapp, Instagram, Youtube and 2-3 Phone Calls on Mobile Data congratulation you have low battery.

I spend 38k for Camara, small size, eSim , A13 chip and future updates to use my Phone in low power mode(AppleSupport Suggested).

Personally I will not buy apple's any new budget phone. I expect this to be best but unfortunately last. Will sell it in some time. Please connect to buy.

If any one dont have this I guess you are blessd !"
330,5,Brilliant,"My first iPhone!! Expected size a little bigger, but it's pretty amazing and handy. More preferrable to girls because of its handy size and battery status. Display, smoothness and many things are *100 times better than Android. Also got the instant discount of 3600. Thank you Flipkart for the amazing product and on time delivery. Nice experience!"
331,3,Does the job,"this phone is a camera beast,has a fastest processor A13 Bionic ,most colour accurate display, best haptics, beautiful & slim design its dammn great but only the con in this phone is the bettery life its not good believe me i have tested this phone with video, social media,and gaming but bettery life is the only this that takes this phone back.so if bettery life is your priority don't go for this. rest all good."
332,3,Fair,"GIVING THIS REVIEW AFTER 15/16 days
BATTERY—Worst ,trust me if you’r a student and giving your classes online then kindly don’t buy,because it’s battery literally is the worst part of this phone....It’s been almost 15 days since I am using this phone and it’s battery Heath has decreased up to 3% and that to just within 15 days and trust me I did each and everything to make sure that it’s battery Heath don’t decrease so fast ,like I saw as well as read each and every article about how to keep it’s battery Heath up to the mark but you can not do anything about it’s battery...
VALUE FOR MONEY OR NOT?--If you see according to its performance by totally ignoring the battery thing,then yes it is a nice phone with excellent camera quality..
BUDGET FRIENDLY—It is totally a budget friendly phone with all the qualities any other iPhone can have so yes you should buy it if you are not a student and you only want to use this as your alternative phone,then go for it...
AND LAST THING I WOULD LIKE TO TELL YOU IS
when I started using this phone ,I was a bit nervous as it is an expensive phone and I don’t want anything wrong or bad happen to this mobile phone ,so I literally read almost every article about this phone and about it’s battery thing ,and somewhere I read if you want this phone to work smoothly and you want it to work nice for next five years then all you can do is NOT TOO USE THE PHONE TOOO MUCH ,which is actually the funny thing but unfortunately it is TRUE ,so for the last time I’m giving this advice to every student please don’t buy this phone if you are attending your classes through mobile phones as after a month you will only and only regret about this...But if you are only using this phone for camera and other stuff then GO FOR IT....
I just hope my review would help you a little bit..."
333,4,Good choice,"So basically I shifted from android to IOS , this was the cheapest iPhone and this phone is not for those who play long gaming hour , although this phone can handle any game , battery backup is decent not great but not terrible either ,it last for almost whole day for me , I just use phone for Mail,Call’s,WhatsApp and some YouTube . Camera is good and the feel premium and is very light and using IOS for first time was not easy , almost took 2 day to understand this phone completely, now everything is very easy , Screen size is actually small but good for those who like compact phones , all last this phone justifies it’s cost for me"
334,5,Simply awesome,"Just wow. This phone’s a breeze. The apple ecosystem is obviously extraordinary and with the phone’s chip and ram management one wouldn’t have no lag whatsoever. The camera is excellent and for my usage the battery is sufficient. Better carry a powerbank if you’re a heavy user. If you want a small form factor device and doesn’t want to lavishly splash money, then just go for this."
335,5,Super!,"Its my first iphone. Always wanted to own an iphone and boy its such a great first one. Its really refreshing to use a small screen after such a longe time and it'll surely take some time to get used to it (again). I seriously don't like to use my old oneplus 6 now but ios has some limitations or rather it would take time to get used to it. Thanks flipkart for delivering it the next day, something that i didn't expect from flipkart."
336,5,Super!,"Stands to its reputation …. Apple as always …
- smooth af
- secure af
- sturdy af
- stunning af
Apple af ;)"
337,5,Best in the market!,"Received handset 100% good condition & fast delivery with in 3 days & genuine price
Im happy with Flipkart.
Phone performance is very good very fast
Super stereo dolby sound crystal clear sound
Camera is very good photography & video quality is awesome overall this iPhone se 2020 powerful smartphone in small & cute size. CHHOTA PACKET BADA DHAMAKA….
I love this iPhone model. Great camera for pics and videos
Battery life is good so far with some setting turn of which i never use and when i use i turn those on and i use it in power saving mode all the time so a full day with light gaming of 1hr or more using camera for 1hr or more listening music in my car on youtube and Bluetooth on for couple of hours it gives me full day of battery varing from 4/5 to 6/7 hours sot per day
Performance is top notch plays every game and every task with ease
Very premium phone looks great in black colour small handy phone"
338,5,Perfect product!,It's a good buy. If you want to experience the apple brand. I would suggest you to buy the product. Apple phones are actually good for around 3-4 years post that because of software updates they become quite slow. So a good phone if you usually change your phone post 3 years of usage.
339,5,Must buy!,"Keep it simple.
To be used as a phone only :
Social media apps, video calling , navigation., Quick HD photography , all your day to day utility apps etc...

Special call out on the camera which is brilliant and allows you to take amazing pictures and editing features.

Not suitable for using it as a gaming , movie watching , high screen time consumption activity device - the screen and battery are just not made for it."
340,5,Best in the market!,An iPhone with duel sim capability and a decent battery life. What else do I want?? Extremely handy. Switched from android and loving the decision. a phone that’s better than one plus in all aspects (including price as well). A beautiful piece of equipment.
341,5,Awesome,Compact yet powerful. It’s small size is what made me buy it. Small phones with decent performance and good build quality are a rare sight these days. Go for it if you don’t like to carry phones as big as chopping boards in your pockets.
342,5,Worth every penny,"1. Camera is too good.
2. Performance it's also good just like a beast in a small pack.
3. I don't know why people said about its battery is not good, I think it's good for this phone size ,screen that's why it's a beast in a speed test."
343,4,Good quality product,"This is a great phone with old school features as required by me. Been using for a week n performance great, no lag n only small screen as compared to samsung s10. but that what i wanted a small phone.
1 very important thing battery is very good pls dont read too much as a normal user doing office mails n taking calls battery lasts for 10 hours. for gaming n watching movies perspective its not a great phone but dats not what i wanted so fits d bill for me.

guys planing to buy this - its a good buy at 30k, great performance, good camera n a compact phone with a decent battery."
344,3,Decent product,"Cons:
1. Finger print response time is very slow compared with older version iPhones..
2. Apps are hanging and restarting ..
3. left side loud speaker is very low compared to right side speaker.
4. Reachable facility is not working properly as home button response is very bad
I never felt this kind of issues in older iPhones ..

Pros:

1. Good display
2. Good camera
3. Good network coverage"
345,4,Pretty good,"Great phone. Tough to find such compact phones in the android world. If only Apple had given a charger and earphones, it'd have been awesome. Battery life is fine but not that great. Rest everything is 10 on 10"
346,5,Just wow!,"The best cell phone for those who likes smaller screen size and same performance like XR. Camera clarity is awesome. I am a fan of iPhone, used 4S, 6 and 6S. SE looks like 6/6S but performance is far better."
347,5,Terrific,"This phone is all that you want it for. All the high end phones from other brands may give you good experience but so does iPhone SE and some more. It is splendid in rendering anything you want it to do. Whether playing games, taking photographs, enjoy watching videos online or in an app, everything is smooth and a pleasure to do. The haptic engine enhances any game you play (as it’s described in other brand phones description and reviews). No complaints, except that the battery is just decently good and cost is slightly higher end but if you could get it at a deal price, then it is completely satisfactory. The phone is as good as one plus or Samsung or any high end phone in the market. I loved the fresh experience it gave. Its damn good."
348,5,Brilliant,I am writing this review after 9 days of use. I didn't play games but my son install pubg mobile and it works fine. I use it for various bank transactions and official use only for the reason for security purposes. And the battery works upto 36 hrs. I am happy to have a nice mobile like this though it is little bit pricey.
349,5,Simply awesome,"One of best phone, I upgrade from Iphone 7.. as said battery mAh is 1821 only but it is far better than 3000 mAh of other android phone.. and so fast, I love it.."
350,5,Terrific,"Like many others this was my first iPhone. Being an android user I was very apprehensive at first but decided to give it a shot. At first the only thing that looked out of league was the screen size, but trust me once you get used to it this won’t even matter.

As for the performance it has everything for your day to day need. A stunning camera, premium glass back look and smooth performance will be more than enough for you to win over. Read a lot of negative reviews about battery but if you are an average user the battery won’t disappoint.

Five stars"
351,5,Simply awesome,Fabulous performance with improved battery than previous model which i bought in 2017.....worth buying ....single camera is enough with improved quality ....and better than its rival one plus .......if you want a smaller size phone with great performance than go for it
352,5,Fabulous! Excellent yet Powerful !!,"Have been using iPhone right from years now , upgraded this iPhone Se from iPhone 6s plus , It is simply amazing how it feels and is a very smooth and small phone which i loved .
It has small design which makes it very easy to use and it simply doesn't feel big , people who don't like big phones can simply go with it ."
353,5,Just wow!,"Firstly great thanks to flipkart for the offer price and also for the quick delivery and genuine product
I have been an iphone user since almost 8 yrs now and wanted a secondary phone and I bought this, absolutely handy device and awesome in every way, battery life is also really great, no complaints 😊"
354,4,Worth the money,"Received my device in 48 hours, that too at a remote place. This is my 3rd iPhone ( After iPhone 4S & iPhone 6). Well…. The device is slim & display is top notch. Interface is super quick. Camera is Ok. But I ain’t disappointed since, I use iPhone for official purposes. For photography my Samsung A50 is doing a terrific job. Battery life, I feel, is better than previous iPhone 6. What really disappointed me is

1) No charger came with the box. Luckily I had my previous charger
2) No earphone jack. Although my Sennheiser earphones are in perfect working condition, I still had to order a pair of EarPods"
355,5,Simply awesome,"This is a very special device with much comfortable in hand. Cameras are very good compared to previous gen iPhones, just a major drawback is the battery. Usually it gives 4 hours of SOT which is satisfactory. Those who are planning to buy an iPhone which has good in hand feeling and nice cameras with super performance, then go for it"
356,4,Very Good,"Canara quality is good
Performance is awesome
Excellent for gaming but small screen
And battery performance is not much good
Totally product is nice I loved it 🥰🥰🥰😍😍"
357,5,Worth every penny,"Absolute compact phone.those who need one handy phone,pls go for it
Performance at the best level
Camera also good ,except night photographs
Video quality at the super level
Battery up to mark as its 1821 mAh(screen on time:5 hours if not play BGMI or COD)
Screen LCD panel still bright and colour
Sound quality also the best
Networks good(as i use airtel ,no issue at all)
100% recommended"
358,5,Excellent,"Wanted a small iPhone with home button specifically,, this isn’t small at all!! Great handy phone with amazing camera settings.. Thank you Steve!!"
359,5,Perfect product!,It is a good phone at this price range and In my point of view as a apple lover if you have less budget you can purchase it i really loved it 🙂❤️
360,5,Worth upgrading from iPhone 7 to iPhone SE 2020,"Just upgraded from iPhone 7 to iPhone SE 2020, Great features great camera great performance"
361,5,Excellent,Clicks photographs like an entry level dslr. Best for daily usage if you are not a heavy gamer. Best in segment and class
362,4,Good choice,"Compact, powerful and elegant. Decent camera and display for this price range with A13 chip.
Battery life is also okay for an average user. A satisfied purchase from Flipkart."
363,5,Worth every penny,"Great value for money phone. Coming from the big phones this was sleek, smooth elegant great comfortable to hold. This is not for the heavy usage people because of the small form battery. But a very decent battery for normal use like calls and whatsapp. White color looks more premium and no ear piece and phone heating issue on long calls. Nice phone and Flipkart service is also goods."
364,5,Decent Product,"I'm writing this review after the usage of 6 months. Its a classic product. Performance is above our expectations and camera quality is awesome. The most impressive feature about apple products is its stabiliy for longer periods. Even after receiving numerous updates for the last few months, its stability ha not gone down unlike android phones. The only disappointed fact with regard to SE2 is battery. Really disappointing. Else its a great phone with powerful chipset.

I recommend this phone for those are not that affectionate towards YouTube, Web sires or games. With its 1820 mAh Capacity battery it hardly last for a day.

Overall 3.5/5
If battery issue can be solved its gonna rock."
365,4,Good choice,SE IS GOOD MOBILE and camera result is best my first apple mobile but very good like better android and other device. U have apple so don’t need to camera
366,4,Value-for-money,"Its a great phone in value for money. Works fine with A13 chip.. all good.got it from 33k .

Point to be considered. It dont have face recognition , finger print works fine .
Also with no headset no or usb charging cable coming. One lighting cable and the phone will deliver only. You have to change this from laptop or buy usb type charger cable and adapter later"
367,5,Excellent,Best phone at this range battery backup is also good display is awesome it is best phone for gaming and all other use Ram management is too good. This is best phone it is value for money.Just go for it
368,5,Brilliant,"This is my first iphone and its great !!! This phone is fast and smooth, Camera is par with iphone 11 except the wideangle ofc. I am writing this review after 4 months and till now no major problem or anything just a con is the battery. If you a couch potato and wants a phone for netflix and video streaming then this wont be the perfect choice for you. The battery life is pretty good is your usage is less. Pubg and other games run like butter no lags no shutters just you wont be able to play ...

369,5,Worth every penny,This is my first iphone.. and I really thanks to Flipkart because of the product is very very good not any problem..I really like iPhone se 128 gb white colour is so good looking
370,5,Terrific,"1. Camera is good in good light condition in indoor camera is decent
2. Performence is superb
3 . Look premium"
371,5,Perfect product!,"While we go deep in review we need to understand a fact that this phone is not for heavy users and for photo enthusiasts.
night pictures are not up to mark, but that even apple isn’t claiming for this particular phone.

This phone is very light in weight and delivers very well for what it meant to be.

Things which I like about this phone:
1. Light in weight
2. Having A13 chip set, which delivers all task smoothly
3. Cost effective phone to enter in apple eco system


In the end while purchasing this phone consider your daily phone usage in mind, if you are a heavy gamer or in video blogging then you must buy a fast charger and power bank."
372,5,Best in the market!,"Great performance,great camera and fabulous product at reasonable price. Thanks apple and Flipkart for fast and secure delivery"
373,4,Really Nice,"If someone ask me for to make choices between iPhone and android phones

I always choose iPhone only

About IPHONE SE superb and fantastic who are looking for handy phone with 4.7 inch screen, with all the latest features and choices."
374,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"I am happy to share here the experience I acquired on Flipkart. Apple and a great creation. Awesome in terms of performance, not like the company said in terms of battery. It takes a maximum of two and a half hours to fully charge. As far as the camera is concerned we can only take the best portrait we know of its function after use, overall awesome. The best phone for this price ..."
375,5,Must buy!,Light in hand it’s an Apple product which easily outperforms any and all of its contenders. Packed with all the features it introduces the concept of esim in dual sim with one physical and other esim activated through network provider. It takes just 2 hrs for activation and SMS after 24 hrs. Bandwidth performs slightly better compared to physical one. Image quality is always best and gaming rendering is perfect without lag. Storage and app availability is also good. Not to mention the Audio quality it’s simply the best in class. Best phone for transition from android.
376,5,Perfect product!,One of the best mobile with fantastic camera really loved it but coming to display size and battery backup just little bit disappointed rather then this iPhone se simply good 😍
377,5,Terrific,Best iPhone at this price range. If u want handy iphone with best processor. Then it will suits for u.
378,5,Simply awesome,"Wow worth for money for this price
I still use this last 4 months superb performance
Great quality I dropped many time no damage in body and display thank u iphone and Flipkart"
379,5,Highly recommended,"If you are not into playing games on mobile, then this is the best phone. Quality is amazing. Each and every component is premium whether we talk about camera or even microphone. Most people don’t realise the amount of tiny compromises made by Android phones to reduce cost. iPhone is expensive because it doesn’t compromise on quality even for things that people barely notice. And the best part is that you will continue to receive free OS updates for at least 5 years."
380,5,Awesome,"A powerful beast . iOS is smooth as always. Camera is wow , you can use this as portable camera for your road trips , size is just perfect . Everything is fine from my side , I will update regarding the battery backup after using few months ."
381,5,Perfect product!,"Absolutely fantastic product for the price. It's handy, good for people who prefer small phones. I love the performance."
382,5,Simply awesome,"I'm no one to review this product, since as everyone knows it's APPLE and they maintain the quality as usual. The feedback I can give on this is regarding Flipkart, the package was good, delivery was fast & safely handed over the product.

Adding some personal feel-good points;-

1. Pure piece of tech art
2. Red color is something really needs to look, touch n feel
3. freaking handy [better to use a case to maintain that look for long]
4. Not recommended for hardcore phone addicts when considering battery backup.
5. Camera is natural."
383,4,Delightful,"Don't wait too much to think , just go for it if you have this in mind. Yes it's a compact device and if you have been using phones with big display then it may feel tiny at first but you would get used to it.
A13 bionic is a charm and this brings out camera performance out if the older hardware that this phone has. It's a hybrid beast of a device and can suffice any day to day task. Yes if your intention is heavy gaming then the battery won't last long as it's tiny body holds a small capacity so heavy gaming and extensive camera and videography would dry out the juice pretty quick, other than that if you take photos and videos time to time and not continuosly then it's perfect. The display quality is pretty good too. I purchased this Device 1 year after its launch and am not having any issues yet , so no regrets."
384,5,Delightful,"Display, Performance, Handling is awesome.
Onle two issues you have to mahe with:-
Continuous use of phone will drain out battery very fast.
Camera performance in good light condition is awesome, it's unbeatable. But in low light you will not get such performance. Otherwise it's an awesome product.
Battery standby performance is awesome. As I go to office, after charging it 100% at 08:30 am, battery after 12 hours stays at around 50% in normal usage. However coming back home and then using for around 2 hours continuously on Video calls through Whatsapp, Email checking, web browsing etc it goes down to 10%. Then I charge it back to 80% and and leave it overnight it goes to 70% in morning.

Overall only downside is BATTERY. Otherwise it's a pretty good handy phone. You should not expect continuous usage of more than 4-5 hrs when you are playing a game or playing video over YouTube. You can take it for day to day normal works- For me it's Calls, Whatsapp, Email, Photo capturing, Insta etc..

I am still exploring other features of the iPhone, will update once done."
385,5,Fabulous!,All are well Good and much better than 11 .but battery backup is too bad. I give this rating after 3 months..
386,4,Pretty good,"Its small,sleek and handy. Powered by A13 bionic. So this one is a performance beast in a small body. When it comes to design,its same as iphone 8 but the internals are quite different. It has only one wide angle camera but that one is great. The display is an ips retina display which is not bad. The main drawback is the battery. This phone has 1821mah battery which is too small. If you are a hardcore user then it wont last for a day. And this phone is Ip67 rated and supports wireless and fast charging too. At this price point these features are awesome. Literally to get this phone in this price we need to sacrifice something like batteries and design. Even its an old design its always looks premium bcoz its "
387,5,Brilliant,"Upgraded from 5s, feeling great while using it the touch is smooth and iOS blends perfectly with the hardware"
388,4,Wonderful,"Great Product In terms of Camera and Processing the image
The A13 Bionic chip does its job Great The battery could be better. Overall great product"
389,5,Just wow!,nice product...just be cautious to use the phone judiciously ....in general with light gaming i am getting around a full day with 30% battery left...mostly use it as my primary non-gaming purpose. love the size..fits well unlike a 6 inch phone
390,5,Just wow!,I prefer small phones so this was the perfect choice and the rate at which it was available made it possible for me to buy my first iPhone. Thanks to Flipkart for providing such amazing offer.
391,5,Just wow!,The phone is very fast and smooth never gave me any issue the battery is on low side but camera to gaming all are on top of the line for casual people you don't need a dslr this phone can take some great photos and videos
392,5,Must buy!,i love it just amazing in every field. those who love small and powerful phone they can go for it. superb performance
393,5,Wonderful,"its really good especially the red colour. among 2 variants of 64 gb and 128gb , i will recommend for 128 gb unless it is not for elderly people. It is much cheaper as compared to IPhone 11 and 12 though u get almost everything ."
394,5,"Mind-blowing purchase, Go for it!","I loved it... This phone gives a sense of luxury, security, and good worth of money. Highly recommend this one. Surprisingly the size of it is perfect, never thought it but it is just perfect.
Only one con i.e battery performance is just average will give you 4-5 hrs of SOT but it has a great stand-by time.
Go for it!"
395,5,Fabulous!,Phone reached me safely. Packaging was nice. Happy with the seller’s integrity. A Mighty handy phone for everyday use. Battery is on the lower side and hardly needs a charge every evening depending on the usage. Otherwise A class.
396,4,Wonderful,"Most affordable classy phone in the market , I bought this product red for my mother and this color enhanced the glamour of the person holding it."
397,5,Great product,"I am writing this review after few days of use so it is just awesome. Camera quality is not satisfactory as the video made by this phone are yellowish in colour as compared to other phone videos.
Speed is just awesome as A13 Bionic chip is there.
Battery is 1800 mAh so it doesn’t last long as iPhones are not made for long lasting batteries but they are light in weight and high performance with no problem of hang.
I used my Iphone 6s for 4 years 8 months so I expect this one to last ling at least for 4 years.
I have downloaded itunes in my PC and previous phone 6s was synced so when I synced new iPhone on same PC I got all the settings and data as it was in previous phone. That means I got my previous phone with new performance hardware."
398,5,Fabulous!,"Excellent investment if you want to experience ios at such a low price with flagship features. If you love classic phones, it is just made for you. You can do everything in this phone. Battery is not so good, but if you are not a heavy user, it will work for you. Camera is excellent as compared to other android phones but not as good as other iphones. It will feel glossy in your hands. And rest all the features are just brilliant."
399,5,Super!,"I’ve been using this iPhone since last 6 months previous to this I was using iPhone 7.
It is the awesome phone without a doubt.
But if you want a bigger screen you’re not going to enjoy this, if you want a compact and comfortable screen this is the phone to purchase."
400,4,Good choice,"Overall it’s a good mobile for daily usage, those who like compact phone and don’t not play much games and don’t watch much movies can buy this phone as battery and small screen are concern."
401,5,Awesome,"If you like to use a premium phone, solid buildup design and processor then don’t give it a second thought. It’s so gooood I love it!!! There is no comparison between android and apple"
402,5,Brilliant,This is my first iPhone and I start this journey with best technology A13 bionic chip with a economical budget it's fantastic and I always keen to use Apple technology in future. Worthy
403,5,Highly recommended,It’s a very fast usable with one hand it’s camera is also very nice it can shoot videos up 4K 60 FPS if it’s battery would be bigger it would be an ideal phone
404,5,Perfect product!,such a really nice phone but is this only undar 30k best its value is only 30k is ok more than not good
405,5,Awesome,"Writing the review after 6 months usage-
-no lags, battery is good for one day usage.
-not for gaming
-u get good 📷
Next powerful after 7, 8 with latest processor.
It’s just better if u want to upgrade from 6s or later, like I did."
406,5,Super! and Value for money product from Apple,"Amazing product from apple and got at a special price during the Republic day sale on Flipkart

Pros:

Fast processor
Superb Camera
Premium fit and Finish
Hassle free interface
Bloatware free (its IOS)

Cons:

None except for short battery life but still people will like it and better than any other phones in this price range"
407,3,Decent product,"There you have a youngest phone of the apple family in term of price ,but this little champ is very weak in term of battery life otherwise SE is good to go for any fight because it got the right genes
As an secondary phone this will work best otherwise carry an powerbank with you"
408,4,Worth the money,"Iphone doesn't need any major review as it's already a pioneer in its own field. However qeith Iphone SE, this works well for those who have tight budget and can't afford high end iphones. Works well for single hand usage, quite good screen to body ratio and latest processor (iphone 11). Will not disappoint anyone who would like to go for iphone."
409,4,Value-for-money,A good phone I say but not the best As battery life is not at all to the apple standard. Otherwise value for money if available during offer period.
410,5,Highly recommended,"Awesome phone, small and handy, I got it for just 21,500 with exchange ....so it was a great deal.....performance is top notch ,display is at its best, ,sound quality is good,camera is at its best with great video recording at 4k 60 fps and portrait mode is also good
Only problem that I found was that iPhone starts vibrating when speakers are in use .
Overall its good ..go for it guys"
411,5,Classy product,"It’s been almost a week since I’ve started using the phone and it’s pretty impressive for the specs it gets. I upgraded from the 6 which happens to have the same battery as this one but the phone has been lasting a complete day easily and definitely way more than my 6 did when I bought it. Coming to the highly complained 1821 mAh battery, I charge it in the morning around 9 and it has 20% left before I go to bed. Then again, it’ll vary from user to user.

The iOS experience along with the A13 bionic chip is simply insane. The battery optimisation is unbelievable and although it has a 3 GB ram, it works like a monster.

The display is an LCD but the colour contrast is superb and the blacks are surprisingly good. Honestly, unless you’re a technical nerd, the 60Hz LCD Display will not be disappointing.

The bezels might be concerning for some people who have been using recent android phones which have the full screen displays but if you’re upgrading from an older android or an iPhone 8 or older it’s nothing to worry about.

The camera is excellent and is easily comparable to those of flagship androids or even the iPhone 12 series. You’ll be capable of shooting videos at 4K 60fps with brilliant Stabilisation. Yes, you do compromise on the night mode and ultra wide camera but then again, people upgrading from older phones or those who don’t use the camera constantly will not miss it.

The biggest buying point should be the fact that it’s going to last you at least 5-6 years for this price compared to the maximum of 3/4 years on androids for the same price. It’s extremely durable with the IP67 water and dust resistance and servicing (both Apple and 3rd party repairs) is also cheap due to a majority of its external hardware coming from the older iPhones.

For the record, the SE 1st gen (launched in March 2016) is still getting iOS and security updates. That’s 6 years of software support. My 6 has been running from 2015 till now. It stopped getting iOS updates 2 years back but I’m still getting security updates and it’s only gone through a battery replacement and 2 screen replacements till now.

If you’re looking for the cleanest, safest and the most reliable and smooth software experience along with pretty good hardware, this one should be a no brainer."
412,3,Decent product,"I bought it for 26k during sale, so it was a good deal. These are the pros and cons which I listed after using it for 2 months.
Pros
1. Good Camera.
2. Incredible performance.
3. Water and dust resistant.
4. Tells your usage time.
5. Handy to use.

Cons
1. Pathetic battery(android phones with price < 6k have outstanding battery)
2. Takes too long for charging(1.5 hr from 0 to 100)
3. No physical slot for second sim card, it has esim feature. (Not all service providers give this facility)
4. No MicroSD card slot."
413,3,Good,"I always wanted to buy an iPhone, to myself experience the Hype surrounding it. Finally, I bought it during the Big Billion Days Sale on Flipkart & below are my observations after using it for almost 3 months.

1) Sound: If you not using any earphones, headphones or any other Bluetooth Devices for getting Sound output, then Sound output of the Mobile in use plays a very important part. While on a call in a noisy Environment & having patchy Network, it becomes very difficult to have a proper conversation without having to ask person at other end to repeat, every now & then. This is where iPhone SE scores full marks. The Sound output is really good while talking normally. If you put the phone on Loudspeaker, then you can easily do multi-tasking on the phone or otherwise. Even for listening to few songs, iPhone SE is quite good.

2) Camera: What impressed me most about the Cameras is that inspite of it being Single Camera (on both back & front), it manages to click very good pics under proper lights. Apple does not boast about high Mega Pixel Cameras, but photos clicked with my iPhone seems natural. It does not make us artificially beautiful like its Chinese Counterparts. Also, the Software optimization & bokeh effects available on iPhone SE can easily compete with any other smartphone in sub 25K range & easily beat them hands down. I will not talk about Night Vision, because it is simply not made for it. The nearest competition it faces is from OnePlus Nord & Google Pixel 4A, both of which have Night Vision.

In short, it is having the best sound output & camera (Photo effects) if you get 128 GB below 30K.

3) Battery: It is the biggest let-down of this phone. Though it supports wireless charging, you will have to buy it separately for minimum 1K. Even under moderate use, you will have to charge the phone more than once a day. I have switched on the Low Data Mode & started using Low Power Mode regularly, to get more battery backup from my Phone. If you are using Wi-Fi or Mobile Data & Siri, then the battery levels drop drastically fast & thats why I use them very less..

4) Updates: You cannot do software updates through your Mobile Data. If you do not have a Wi-Fi (like me), you will need to switch on the Mobile Hotspot of other Device & connect your iPhone to that Mobile Hotspot & only then, the download & install button becomes available for use. Using Mobile Data, it will only show the availability & size of Software Update. Even after connecting to a Wi-Fi, the screen will be stuck on estimated time remaining for many hours, without any progress.

Till date, my Phone has received 3 updates (the latest being IOS Version 14.3, received yesterday). But everytime, I have to connect iPhone to my Laptop using its Cable & upgrade using iTunes downloaded on my Laptop using Recovery Mode on iPhone. One more thing that I have observed is that while the update size shows approx. 533 MB on my Phone, when I connect it to iTunes on my Laptop, it downloads almost 5-6 GB of data everytime. It takes 30-45 minutes of time to install the IOS update.

5) Miscellaneous: It does not allow you to disable the dialler sound without putting the phone on Silent using the Slider button. It is Water-Proof to some extent, but I have not tried it till now. It supports fast-charging of 18 Watts, so use a good branded Power Adapter for charging (less waiting). Its back is glossy, hence is a fingerprint magnet & its screen will easily get scratches. So use a back cover & go for a toughened glass for the Screen. It supports Dual Sim (one Physical Sim & one E-Sim). Jio & Airtel users can get E-Sim for iPhone SE in India. You will get Apple Music free for 90 days & Apple TV free for 1 year, but I have not activated either of them till now.

Thanks & Regards,"
414,5,Great product,"Nice phone with great camera, loved it. Everything is perfect just the battery is not as good as expected."
415,3,Just okay,"Ossam phone,my first I phone so very much excited to use this.everything is great except battery but u may optimise battery usage by making suitable settings and after that all great. Finally want too say only one thing No I phone user will never use any other brand phone."
416,5,Classy product,"My dream phone. When I was in college in year 2015 most of my friends who had “rich parents” had iphones and I always dreamed of owning one. In fact that time I just had the nokia push button old phone which wasn’t even a smart phone.
With the blessing of my mother and the support of my brother I was able to fulfill this dream of owning an iPhone.

I am not an expert of mobile but I am grateful to flipkart and its seller for providing great discount so that it became affordable for common people like me.

Even if you buy it from apple store or any other local mobile shop the price is almost 30% higher.

Thank you flipkart ! You fulfilled a dream..."
417,5,Awesome,If you want a compact and handy phone ..just go for it. I boight it for its size. Battery backup is decent considering the size and performance. Value for money.
418,5,Highly recommended,"Best budget phone for proffessional user.
It is best suitable phone for isers who don’t use phone for gaming.
It gives me a full day battery life with continuous 4g On"
419,5,Classy product,"Pros:
1. Top notch performance
2. Very good display
3. Pretty handy in size
4. Beautiful design
5. Battery is far better than 1st Generation SE. Just do the following when you get the device, Enable power save mode, disable background refresh. You can happily use the back up more than a day.
6. You can charge the device 60-70% in an hour with 5W charger. Pretty decent.
7. When you get the device first thing to do is update the IOS from 13.6v to 14.0v. You will definitely feel the difference in the performance.

Cons:
1. Both front and rear cameras are too noisy in low light. Disappointed!
2. Front camera is not good.
3. Home button press is not comfortable smooth. Little disappointed!

Over all awesome and amazing mobile❤️"
420,5,Highly recommended,"This is my first iPhone, switched over from android and I am using this phone for a month now.
So here are some things I found, as an overall product is it very good, if you like small phones like me.
Now talking about Pros:
1. Good build quality.
2. Very fast processing, the best I have ever seen.
3. Very Good Camera Quality.
4. Water Resistance IP67 Certified.
5. Support wireless charging and fast charging.
6. Stereo speakers with good sound quality.
7. Easy to use with one hand and you can have good grip while holding your phone.
Now talking about the negatives:
1. Low battery life it lasts for me only about 6-7 hours on a continuous usage and even less on full brightness.
2. Absence of Night Mode in the camera.
3. Switching from android I could not find the way to clear cache and data for apps which sometimes gets even more than the actual size of app and the only way I could find was to uninstall it and reinstall it.
4. Could not share pictures via Bluetooth which I could do in android."
421,5,Just wow!,"I am hard-core android user recently i used redmi note 5pro and it has 4000mah battery and its battery life is good

And after using iphone se i am shocked its battery is good and performance is best in class and i used OnePlus also believe me OnePlus and any android never replace a iphone

iPhone is iphone in all point

Camera is best
Performance is best in class
Display is small but its okay
Battery is also good"
422,4,Wonderful,"The phone is brilliant however the battery performance is not great
Max 1 day battery life for a normal usage
Highly not recommended for gaming
Camera is good
The interface reminds of old iPhones
Value for money
Ppl looking for small compact phone, this the best phone however need to compromise with the battery."
423,4,Good quality product,"This is my 2nd iPhone after 6years came back with excitement & here it is SE it’s simply clever, for excitement this right treat for me.

My 1st IPhone 5s gifted from my sweet heart for cross 1st year after my lover came wife she gifted for my 1st anniversary.
I love small screen phone 5s, 5se, 6, now 2020 SE comes with everything into in small phone except battery 😔 Apple can put better battery capacity for SE but ok it’s shoots for everyone except for gamers. It’s fits into your budget & performance, camera, nice & handy if you planning for iPhone without any doubt go for it & but this is not a gaming phone slightly disappoint.

Delivery I have to mention this, Flipkart delivered within 15hours that was OMG 😲 I got my phone I was shocked still, I lives in chennai & box 📦 package was good & delivery person maintained social distances as well

About seller SUPERCOMNET some of reviews from other social media’s not from Flipkart reviews after reading that review I was scared very badly but next day I got phone I cross checked 🧐 everything quality of phone, package & accessories everything is ORIGINAL finally 👍🏻 what I get from my side seller, no problem with seller it’s genuine.

All over my rating for IPHONE SE📱is 4.5 out of 5."
424,4,Delightful,"Flipkart took 2 weeks to deliver the product. Never mind, the phone is really good,compact. The charge drops a bit fast ,for heavy users it should last for a max of 6-7 hours. Rest everything is just top notch. Best budget buy"
425,5,Terrific purchase,"The best thing is size. Fits in your palm and very easy to operate. Looks are fantastic. Home button is what I was excited about. Overall it's a very good device, both in looks n performance. Hope to use it for at least 3 years"
426,4,Delightful,"A13! what else you need, perfect camera, awesome display, classy build, just battery performance is weak, heavy usage goes for 6hrs, normal can work for 20hrs"
427,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"Phone is simply awesome. Perfect size to hold in hand. Got 10-12 hrs back up in a day with moderate usage. I don’t use phone for gaming, it’s only for social media and calling purpose. Camera quality is very impressive, in nights too. Front camera is awesome it takes nice clicks in low light also. It was a right decision to buy this phone."
428,4,Good choice,The Phone is outstanding except for the battery backup. U have to modify the system setting to use the phone for full day without charging. Turn off the unnecessary location and display services to use the phone seamlessly. Not recommended for heavy Gamers and Multimedia Users. Best entry level phone for experiencing IOS. Processor is super fast.
429,4,Nice product,"I love this phone and was waiting for it for quite sometime now. Excellent phone & is likely to remain in the market for 2 years. Love the specs, very handy and since i upgraded from iphone se (1st gen), didn’t have any problem. The only minus, i was expecting and read on multiple forums as well, is the battery. Highly disappointed with the battery. They should have squeezed in about 2500 mah and i am sure this phone would have been more successful. But besides that i believe this is the best phone. Thank you Apple and flipkart for prompt service delivery here.."
430,5,Excellent,"My earlier iPhone model was iPhone 8,after that I used honor 8X,Oneplus 7t and vivo v19.My personal experience is the ui and quality of iPhone is damn good and you won’t like any other phone .Even the camera is single lens decent pictures without smudges are getting.Most users complain about battery life,in my opinion I am getting Decent battery life better than 8 and if you use it with reduced brightness ,no vibration you will get 24 hrs battery life.best low budget iPhone without any lag,go for it"
431,5,Classy product,Very good for those who love small handy phones..it's same size as iphone 8.. would not recommend for playing pubg continuously..but it's good for all other use
432,4,Really Nice,"Just ignore the battery performance.. the phone is good to use.. the experience is of using iOS is flawless..
No fast charger..
Music is the best part of iphone SE.. which is remarkable
Screen size mmm yes its small.. but its ok to use.. but it works like as it is designed for smooth experience..
I have Old SE as well.. apple experience is no doubt is amazing without any lag...
Ignore the battery performance.. rest perfect for daily use.."
433,5,Highly recommended,"Got it on sale.delivered on 15 aug.
Nostalgia.
Beautiful phone in red colour.build quality looks amazing,camera is amazing.
UPS is compact size.
Don’t know why people are complaining about battery life I got the phone at 75% battery ,I’ve been using it for almost 6 hours and still the battery is at 35%.
However don’t expect it to give a good battery back up when you play games on this phone,not for gamers and moderate to heavy users.
It’s perfect for me."
434,3,Fair,I edited this just after 3 months of use that the battery is so so bad that i had to refill it atleast twice a day and it takes more than 2 hours to refill. This mobile was great in terms of performance and camera but lacks a little bit on the design and battery. The design was bit outdated and the mobile takes more than 2 hours to refill. The IOS experience was great but i do prefer the android experience which is free and have more variety in it. In this price range the only competitors are oneplus 8 and s10lite but i was looking for the handy phone with the reliable camera and performance and I loved it. If any android device offers the mobile with size. I would choose that blindfolded
435,5,Fabulous!,I love this phone. Camera is amazing and battery life is very good. It’s fast as well.
436,5,Simply awesome,"I was an Android user and this is the first iPhone I’ve ever used. This phone has the best 4g processor, the thing that makes your phone last longer. The camera is decent with better pictures in day light when compared to night photos. The battery is of less capacity but if you are a light to average user, you can breeze through your day. A big NO if you are a gamer though."
437,3,Does the job,If a phone with 4 hours screen on time does not sound exciting then I'd say skip the phone. You'd have to charge this phone twice a day for normal use. Rest it's snappy and has a good camera.
438,5,Worth every penny,"Just SUPERB!! Highly satisfied as it is ""completely meets My Requirements"" ! :-) Thanks to Flipkart as well for the fast and seamless delivery."
439,5,Wonderful,"Very good cell phone.

Perfectly designed, right dimensions and updated features makes it Best Buy

Thank you Flipkart for this amazing buy back and HDFC discount offers"
440,5,Just wow!,"Apple is Apple !!

I already have i phone 11 but I purchased this phone due to it’s Compact Size . I m using this phone Since 10 days... I phone SE provides exceptional performance in every terms ... I didn’t found any Con ... i used to do workout and running and this phone is easy to keep in my pocket due to its size"
441,5,Great product,"After two weeks of usage , my review is that this phone is super smooth in operations and very high performance and great camera . If you want a small phone which is very handy while driving then this phone is for you. Battery charging is required twice a day, if you are travelling then I suggest you purchase a power bank. The stereo speakers are also load enough."
442,5,Super!,Ultimate phone...smooth and value for money. Battery life is also good . I am loving the phone...super fast technology and the camera quality is awesome...
443,5,Classy product,"I bought this for my sister.she is very happy with it.
also thanks Flipkart for this wonderful phone.delievery was on time.also safe with OTP at the time of delivery"
444,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"I am not a tech guy. I use my phone only for essential services. I don’t watch a lot of stuff on my phone but I read and browse a lot. I wanted a handy phone but I wasn’t sure if I should splash this cash on an iPhone. Always used android and was a bit apprehensive about moving to the Apple space.

But what can I say, the hype is real. I’m experiencing something else. It’s super buttery smooth and extremely comfortable to use. I don’t play a lot of games but I like to do everything else fast. I multitask a lot and this perfect for that. All in all, I absolutely am in love with the phone. Haven’t been this enamoured by a phone in a long time.

I can’t say much about the technicalities. Because I don’t know or don’t care. It works well for me. I do realise that the question will remain, as to why I didn’t go for a normal android phone. I’m hoping to use this for at least 4 years. Last two android phones I got for around 18K each died on me in a year or 1.5. Hopefully this won’t."
445,4,Very Good,"If you are looking for a switch from android to iOS then iPhone se is the best option at this price range. Performance is excellent - thanks to the A13 bionic chipset. But for an android lover there are so many options at this price. Just go for that.

Pros
* Performance is masterclass including gaming.
* Daylight camera performance is great. Good for photography but excellent for videography
* Smooth display. It is only LCD display but far better than android phones LCD displays
* Wireless charging is working good
* Compact feel that fits for a single hand use

Cons
* Design is 5 years older. Huge bussels are annoying
* Only HD display
* Night mode is not available in camera. So night camera quality is below average
* Even though the device is capable of fast charging apple gives only a 5w very normal charger
* Battery performance is just average. Not recommended for a heavy user"
446,5,Best in the market!,"Hands down the best value for money product in the segment. On one hand we have the best in class A13 bionic processor and on the other hand the best mobile operating system ever. With the privacy features but into iOS 14 it i THE PHONE to own in these times.
The camera also never disappoints as it takes amazing pictures without you even thinking about the exposure.

Highly recommend it to anyone who doesn’t like big bulky phones and need a super fast and secure operating system performance."
447,5,Just wow!,"Phone has a very good build quality, performance is pretty good. Camera is pretty decent, battery backup is however not up to the mark given the fact that it has a 1821 mAH battery."
448,5,Worth every penny,If you want a small and powerful phone and have charging facility at your workplace then go for it. This is the best value for money and best performer ever.
449,3,Just okay,"Good features like smart wake up , hands free Siri , good amount of Storage , heavy carrying feeling , Video quality
Weakness is weak battery and no so much outbound sound quality"
450,5,Just wow!,"Apple is Apple !!

I already have i phone 11 but I purchased this phone due to it’s Compact Size . I m using this phone Since 10 days... I phone SE provides exceptional performance in every terms ... I didn’t found any Con ... i used to do workout and running and this phone is easy to keep in my pocket due to its size"
451,5,Great product,"After two weeks of usage , my review is that this phone is super smooth in operations and very high performance and great camera . If you want a small phone which is very handy while driving then this phone is for you. Battery charging is required twice a day, if you are travelling then I suggest you purchase a power bank. The stereo speakers are also load enough."
452,5,Super!,Ultimate phone...smooth and value for money. Battery life is also good . I am loving the phone...super fast technology and the camera quality is awesome...
453,5,Classy product,"I bought this for my sister.she is very happy with it.
also thanks Flipkart for this wonderful phone.delievery was on time.also safe with OTP at the time of delivery"
454,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"I am not a tech guy. I use my phone only for essential services. I don’t watch a lot of stuff on my phone but I read and browse a lot. I wanted a handy phone but I wasn’t sure if I should splash this cash on an iPhone. Always used android and was a bit apprehensive about moving to the Apple space.

But what can I say, the hype is real. I’m experiencing something else. It’s super buttery smooth and extremely comfortable to use. I don’t play a lot of games but I like to do everything else fast. I multitask a lot and this perfect for that. All in all, I absolutely am in love with the phone. Haven’t been this enamoured by a phone in a long time.

I can’t say much about the technicalities. Because I don’t know or don’t care. It works well for me. I do realise that the question will remain, as to why I didn’t go for a normal android phone. I’m hoping to use this for at least 4 years. Last two android phones I got for around 18K each died on me in a year or 1.5. Hopefully this won’t."
455,4,Very Good,"If you are looking for a switch from android to iOS then iPhone se is the best option at this price range. Performance is excellent - thanks to the A13 bionic chipset. But for an android lover there are so many options at this price. Just go for that.

Pros
* Performance is masterclass including gaming.
* Daylight camera performance is great. Good for photography but excellent for videography
* Smooth display. It is only LCD display but far better than android phones LCD displays
* Wireless charging is working good
* Compact feel that fits for a single hand use

Cons
* Design is 5 years older. Huge bussels are annoying
* Only HD display
* Night mode is not available in camera. So night camera quality is below average
* Even though the device is capable of fast charging apple gives only a 5w very normal charger

461,5,Excellent,Nice product witha nice camera.Good budget iphone but its not really a budget phone if compared to other android phones.The battery could be a little better and it could have provided a good port for connecting headphones or earphones
462,5,Excellent,It’s Awesome I liked this mobile very much. It’s compact and powerful
463,4,Really Nice,"Very good phone very convenient to use due to it’s size. Display is no problem if you can connect to iPad via hotspot and enjoy watching videos and reading articles. Even playing games on my mini iPad.
Battery performance could have been better as people are dependent on their phones to a great extent for their daily activities. So if you use the phone except for heavy gaming it should get you thru the day easily.
So why should you choose it: well it’s an iPhone and It’s fantastic performance.
Flipkart did a great job delivering before the schedule date."
464,4,Really Nice,If you are buying this phone then you might as well consider buying iphone Xr. The display is very small and could’ve been much much bigger. The battery is good but could’ve been better
465,5,Highly recommended,Battery is a not great and not for a person who can’t charge this phone for 2 times a day. And gamers I would suggest u this phone only if u can keep it on charge when not gaming. Overall performance beast. PUBG is as smooth as butter. Didn’t get any single frame drop when 4 squad hotdrop Ace tier. Camera is really good. U would be happy on your clicks during daytime or on strong artificial light but obviously not at night. Worth the money coz 4-5 years of software update is really awesome.
466,5,Worth every penny,I used iPhone X and 11 bt I can’t get Comfort while useing bt se 2020 is most Comfortable and beautiful phone I like it phone should be like se
467,4,Pretty good,The phone could be the best in segment if equipped with a turbo or wireless charger and Bluetooth EarPods. It gives a premium feel with a compact 4.7” design and Super fast processor.
468,5,Worth every penny,Great product as usual. Good for a days use. Need a fast charger with it to get the best performance in short time. There’s nothing to complain except battery performance.
469,4,Very Good,"Everything is fine except battery. I’m not an pubg player so I can’t Specify the performance on basis of pubg. But I didn’t find any lag or slowness in this phone. Main point of this phone is.
- very thin and slim
You will love it when you will start using it.

I think only drawback is it’s battery. If the battery was good. It was best. But anyway we can not expect that much battery backup from apple.
I think apple should do more work on battery at least make it on the mark.

I bought it aft...

474,5,Perfect product!,"Mobile is working awesome fast and smooth. Camera is very awesome but problem is only size of mobile display
But over all I’m very happy with phone"
475,5,Fabulous!,The rumors about this phone of its low battery backup are fake. It provides the best battery backup and lasts a full day with light use like Instagram and WhatsApp. The performance of this phone is the best compared to android phones at this price range. And with the iOS 14 update the iPhone SE is the star of the show . And there are no such noticable differences between the SE and the 12
476,2,Moderate,"Only good thing about this phone is its processor.
What is the use of good processor if you ve average camera below average screen size. I ve not udapted to new software but the UI is not that friendly with the present software version. You ll get very good Android phone for the same price. Or if you can shell out extra bucks then go for higher version of iPhone. This is not worth it."
477,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"From a first time iOS user

I am using Pixel 4a and I got this phone for my wife. Very smooth experience, quite different then regular android and marginally better then Pixel's.

Camera quality is quite good, even in comparison to Pixel, but I believe it's mostly because of its punchy colours.

Layout/Usability/UI is quite different and it's taking some time to get used to it.

Hardware is very premium, better then my existing pixel 4a.

Functionality and Customization wise I find it lacking behind pixel (for a heavy user) but for a regular everyday user, it's okay, gets all the required jobs done

Overall, nice experience."
478,5,Mind-blowing purchase,Iphone SE 2020 is the best iphone. I had iphone6 so i am used to this size and this screen size is perfectly fine and handy as well and light weight. Very happy with this buy. Bought a red one and its amazing red.
479,4,Great phone but disappointed with no accessories,"Good phone but disappointed with no earpods and power adapter. Left a bittersweet taste.
Battery backup is good enough for only decent usage. Not meant for gaming. Only for those who want entry into the Apple ecosystem at low cost"
480,5,Perfect product!,"Ordered iphone SE 2020 from Flipkart and no regrets till now.
This is my second iPhone purchase from Flipkart and they delivered it well within time.
Phone is genuine, nicely packed (hats off to Apple Packaging Team too)
Very nice upgrade from IPhone 6 - 16 GB.
Used it for more than a week now; seems flawless.
The Red Product is a special one to own as Apple donates from the sales of Red Products.
The glass back looks very nice, however needs lot of care to prevent scratches.

Cons: Battery life is not as good as other phones in this price category and much lower than the new iphone models running on the same Apple A13 chip.
Sometimes the info on the home screen top (carrier, wifi, time and battery information) goes blank.

Overall a perfect buy if one does not want the new larger phones.

Thanks to Flipkart for the smooth ordering and delivery process."
481,5,Just wow!,"Switched from iPhone 6 to iPhone SE 2020.
Never wanted the big sizes, this is the best option as a beast in a small shell.

In a short note, giving 9 on 10 for this product."
482,3,1 week user,"The product is great in itself, other than the battery. I have a 2016 iPhone 6 and the battery life if pretty similar to that. Really hoping that Apple does something about the battery life in coming update. Other than that everything is great and it delivers what you're promised. A-13 bionic chip will amaze you with the speed and camera is great, specially for the price.

483,5,Great product,"Best in the market
Seriously no android phone can compete with this 4.7 inch beast performing device. A13 Bionic is far more superior than Snapdragon 865. I am an hardcore android guy & I am giving my genuine review after 4 days of extensive IOS usage"
484,4,Really Nice,The iPhone SE 2020 is a real value for money mobile device. It has got the latest processor (A13 Bionic Chip) which is said to be the fastest processor that is present in the current market. The camera is a real catch having support for high definition video and photos that can be shot in portrait mode which adds a certain depth to the photos. The 4.7 inch screen is a real compact and comfy size for those who do not prefer large phone sizes. The battery life is great as well. All in all the iPhone SE 2020 is a great device at a reasonable price and has a set of great specs like those of the higher end Apple devices.
485,5,Fabulous!,Best camera quality a. A good option to buy at a reasonable price too. Would totally recommend buying this mobile

489,5,Super!,It's lighting fast and picture quality is marvelous. Excellent battery except that if you are more on online streaming and gaming then you need to carry a 20k mah power bank.

501,4,Pretty good,"I was using iPhone 6s earlier. So for me this phone is not an upgrade as such because the features are almost the same in both phones. Only in iPhone SE there is dual sim and front camera is of 7MP. Still I’m loving this phone. It has got a decent battery life (as compared to iPhone 6S) and the look and feel of this phone, especially in red colour is awesome. The camera and phone performance obviously are good as with all iPhones. For first time iPhone users, this should be the best phone to upgrade to. This phone won’t disappoint. Thank you Flipkart for delivering this phone within 24 hours."

503,5,Perfect product!,"For a Advanced Old School freek.
1. Battery backup is quite good as most of working type guy like me frequently use call, whatsapp, email on a daily basis in such case it will last for 11 hrs .
2. Handy for me it's smart & fast but not a phablet like device for me Its 4'7 inch display is called phone .
3. No need for Fast charger as it get full charged with in 2.30 hrs just put it after wake up & take it once you are ready .

Rest things are mentioned by others for me I just want a smart speedy basic mobile phone ....loved it"
504,5,Brilliant,I bought this phone with excitement and its really a fast phone. I like its fast processing and camera clarity but battery is little week in this phone.
505,4,Worth the money,Nice single camera phone with average battery backup but I feel the price should be less than 40k as per the features of the phone. Overall I don't recommend to buy it just because of the price. But if you want an iPhone its the cheapest option(launched in 2020)
506,5,Excellent,It’s a pretty robust phone. Powerful then my Mac or my windows laptop. My screen time is around 7 hours as I do most of my stuffs from my phone. Be it a presentation or a photography- this device is very powerful . Thanks to Apple
507,5,Must buy!,"Compact size for those who want to use mobile phone with one hand, performance very fast and very smooth thanks to Bionic chip 13."
508,2,Expected a better product,"The phone just works ok. The battery backup is worst. Its only a few months and the battery health is reduced to 97%. The battery lasts less than a day. The display is just ok. I have a 3 year old iPhone xr which works great still.
Recommended for only those people who need small size budget iPhone."
509,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"Pretty good device for the offer price, not that great battery life, everything else is top notch."
510,5,Classy product,Super phone and super camera and batter performance is bad and display super value for money also good and phone is very fast
511,4,Wonderful,"Average camera quality if you love best camera phone then this is not the product for you
Average battery life also can't comment much since it's only few weeks before I purchased but definitely it's not a good battery
Apart from camera and battery rest of the phone can match with expensive phone features. It has A13 chip which means performance will be better than iPhone 8 and 10"
512,4,Value-for-money,"This thing is crazy fast and captures crispy photos but doesn’t have nightmode ( now a days 10k phone’s have nightmode) .

513,5,Just wow!,"Pros :
Excellent performance
Zero lags
Good software support
Excellent camera
Better / stable apps compared to android

Cons :
Mediocre battery life

Note: display is good enough for a 4.7'' phone. No pixelation
It can run all the demanding games and can take really good pics . The only thing you need to understand is that for a heavy user the battery will last from 10 am - 4 pm"
514,5,Super!,"Apple products are the best designed and architected devices with leading industry standards.
this one is best for casual use. one of the fastest devices in this price range.

Overpriced as per tech experts.
The battery is best in ios devices.
The camera is average but you can click stunning pics in Daylight.
You can Opt for these Devices if your use is decent.
If you love Android Os and Chinese phones such as Redmi, one plus then don't buy this one. Sometimes it is difficult to adjust industry standards when you stuck to basic products.

If you need performance, speed, and durability buy it without hesitation."
515,2,Could be way better,"It is fully hawa Naz phone . Back bottom on top so it is not comfort to easy back chapare to other phone.

Charger need to be commonized
Battery need to be increase"
516,3,Good,"I had no other option so opted for this as I have been using iPhone for the past 12 yrs now. People who love to be on most of the time(gaming n browsing), this piece is not good for you as battery still sucks.
Music lovers you can have a superb feel on speaker as apple has got it better than previous ones."
517,4,Good quality product,"Everything is excellent about this phone. Compact size, nice bright display, superb performance. Except for the battery. It hardly covers entire days. But over the time battery performance improved a little as it understands the usage."
518,5,Just wow!,"Performance and camera is great. Screen is about mediocre. Battery is really bad and hardly gets to the end of the day if charged in the morning. This is a good buy if you’re low on budget and you get a great deal. Looks very neat and attractive though. Go for the black color if you’re in doubt, though it’s more grey than black but looks very classy. About a month now and had no issues apart from small battery."
519,5,Best in the market!,I was worried about battery life because of negative comments. But it’s really has good battery back up for which you don’t need to worry about. If you love compact size phone then just go for it. It’s really amazing masterpiece from apple. I am really loving it. Thanks Flipkart.
520,4,Good choice,"This is a superb affordable product from Apple.

Performance : This phone’s performance is nothing lesser than Flagships, it’s top notch. Butter smooth experience.

Design : Feels and looks premium.

Software : Superb and easily adaptable. Mostly importantly no junk and unwanted apps. After being a Android user for years, this is the first time I felt I have full control over my phone and my apps. Privacy = Apple and Apple = Privacy.

Battery: If not for it’s poor battery backup, I would have given 5 stars. Despite being a moderate user, I end up charging it twice a day."
521,3,Good,Buying a basic camera phone this price is not justified unless it is apple product. Camera quality is not good as expected from apple. Far better camera is available at half of price in other brands
522,5,Best in the market!,It is one iPhone that’s value for money. Has the same processing capability of iPhone 11. Only disadvantage is a step down on camera. Works amazing like any other iPhone.
523,5,Super!,GOOD BUY FOR FIRST TIME APPLE USER ALL WORKS GOOD BUT BATTERY IS NOT SO GOOD FOR HEAVY USERS IT WILL GET FOR 7HRS FOR SURE FOR FULL CHARGE AND EASY TO CHARGE FROM 0 TO 100 IN 2AND HALF HOURS GOOD CAMERA QUALITY NO LAG IN MOBILE SMOOTH OS
524,5,Just wow!,Overall best phone for apple fans and who use their phones for light to moderate work.The A13 chip makes the processor faster and the camera of this phone is just splendid ! I would surely recommend this phone to the people looking for an iphone in a low budget :)
525,5,Great product,I have purchased this phone just for the sake of Brand to gift it to my wife.! My Mi Note 9 pro max is way better to enjoy than this. Overall a good phone.
526,5,Best in the market!,This phone is awesome nd value for money all Functions are smooth superb .. camera is not on my expectations ..I gifted this phone my frnd ... nd she likes this. Nd we are happy from this iPhone SE 2020. 👌👌👌😊😊
527,4,Value-for-money,I recently bought iPhone se from flipkart at very good discount price. Great entry level phone from Apple. The camera quality is awesome and speed of iPhone is fast as well. Got a quick delivery from flipkart on the very second after purchasing it. So far I am very happy using this phone. Would recommend this phone to others as well who are looking to buy their first ever Apple iPhone. Great buy.
528,4,Worth the money,"Pros:
1. Good camera
2. Fast processor
3. Secure
4. Fast charging

Cons:
1. NO CHARGING ADAPTER & EARBUDS (Although they are writing that it is included but it is not)
2. Battery"
529,5,Fabulous!,"iPhone SE 2nd Gen. massive to use A13 processor for multiple application and camera clarity extremely amazing with awesome feature its so cool to handle phone and compact... battery level rating its 4star.
Requesting to iPhone: phone is so massive try to improve battery part backup for usage."
530,5,"Excellent, worth buying.","I am writing this review after more than a months usage, so here are my observations and findings.

1. Excellent OS, super fast A13 chip no lag at all. Nice animations, highly customization now with ios 14.1 update. It will amaze you.
2. Superb display especially when you zoom a picture it retains its pixels, awesome.
3. Amazing 4K video at 60 FPS, absolutely amazing clarity.
4. Very good speakers.
5. Very light weight infact you wont feel its in your pocket.
6. Camera is great with good clarity in day light.
7. 64GB default space which is really good.
8. Free apple tv subscriptions for 1 year.

Only downside is less capacity battery one day max use.
If you are heavy user this phone is not for you. If you use for just calls and texting then battery will last a full day.

If you can overlook battery then this phone will amaze you in many ways. Definitely worth every single rupee you put."
531,2,Expected a better product,"It's an outdated very very tiny phone, with a very poor battery life for a tiny phone. Only thing that's good is maybe the camera which again is useless in low light.
Even the Netflix movies don't appear in full screen, imagine having a top and bottom bar while viewing movies on netflix on such a tiny phone. The front facing ear speaker too fades away and becomes in audible in just 2 months despite cleaning it with rubbing alcohol. The performance and the chip is useless if the phone is so tiny. Plus the back glass is extremely brittle and ready to shatter on the slightest of impacts. For those who watch movies on their phones ignore this phone. Only good thing is legendary music quality which apple is famous for."
532,4,Good quality product,"Everything is so awesome about this one, only thing is display which is quiet small. Battery life is good for me . Having 6-7 Hours of screen on time on normal usage."
533,5,Brilliant,Woww. It's an amazing experience with such a small high performance phone. Really loved the working of this phone. The sound quality is tremendous than any other phone. Better than Dolby atmos in android as far as i felt. Better to go for it. One major difference which I have observed with respect to android is that the phone glass is so rigid that it did not have a single scratch even after it got slipped from a 2 ft height. Really awesome quality. Dont think much about battery as they made it light weight so battery capacity reduced. Overall superb performance.
534,5,Best in the market!,"I am very happy with this new version, which is actually a super-improved iPhone 6. The design is a bit different, and my old 6 case covered the camera lens, but with the new case added and everything running, she's about 3 times faster than my 6, has a much better camera, and is waterproof (even better with the case). The battery also lasts longer. Obviously the processor is a lot faster, but a lot cooler as well. I was really surprised at how fast this new SE 2020 is, and you can't beat the price. Transfer was easy, and basically is a super-upgraded version of my 6, Anyone who is still using 6 or 7 should get this phone, but if you have something larger and more complicated, this would be a bit of a downgrade with the trade-off being much faster than what you have, but smaller size, with different functions (you would have to re-learn a bit). I would suggest it to almost anyone looking to upgrade at a very reasonable price."
535,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"Fantastic phone using it as my secondary iphone
It’s smooth and fast thank you Flipkart ❤️"
536,4,Very Good,I am giving my opinion after using 2 days...flip kart delivered it extremely fast...it’s a good budget phone...processor is very fast at least as off now...camera is very good...battery is not that up to mark like other iPhones...I think those who are using iPhone 7 or 8 won’t find much difference but yes this is a value for money product...it’s a sure buy in my opinion
537,4,Wonderful,"I got overheating issues with this phone that I received yesterday, can be a software bug
Battery drains extremely
Performance is better than 11pro
Camera is better than XR
Very handy and comfortable to hold as I like bezel displays"
538,5,Worth every penny,"1. Amazing performance: the speed in opening and closing apps is amazing. iOS always had anyways a much sophisticated feel. The speed has increased it manifold
2. Camera is good but not as much as you’d find in android phones of this budget. That can be foregone considering other advantages. Though I would say that there are some neat features like good quality HDR, slow-mo, Live Photo, ability to move from photo to video. The best feature here is the shutter speed which you will not get in any android phone of this budget, not at least in lower RAM versions. Losing the moment because of slow shutter speed is most annoying. Here you’ll never miss a moment.
3. Size: real estate is less but after few weeks of use I find it an advantage
4. No Face ID: again an advantage because the android phone I have of this same budget has Face ID but it was irritating and slow to recognise even without using mask. Now it makes even less sense with having to wear mask.
5. Apple ecosystem: for someone like me who has other apple products like iPad and MacBook but stopped buying iPhones because of their high price, this is perfect.
6. iOS: the ios13 is amazing and by virtue of having apples latest chip this phone will have greater longevity in terms of iOS updates in future
7. Bye bye google: amazing opportunity to say bye bye to google and it’s privacy-invasive apps. Even apple maps have improved considerably and one can easily use it in place of google maps. CarPlay is also a much suave and sophisticated option to android auto."
539,5,Worth every penny,"Best quality phone.One of its kind,this size phone with A13 chip is unbeatable.For me its size its USP.It comfortably settles inside the pocket & can easily be handled in one hand with tea in other hand.
Camera is excellent even night time clicks are very good."
540,5,Just wow!,"Bought this for my mom and she absolutely loves it. It’s red coloured variant looks really beautiful and elegant. The size is absolutely perfect for her hands, though people with bigger hands would feel little uncomfortable using it. The camera is good except for the portrait mode, that’s not as good as the ones with physical secondary lens, needless to explain that. The performance is pretty amazing for general use though I doubt it’s suitability for gaming (would play games like PUBG, COD very well, but would you get immersive experience playing it on a small phone like this?).Battery life is pretty decent too. Overall, it’s a amazing phone, if you are not much into games and performance demanding borderline stuff."
541,3,Decent product,"This phone have serious battery problems , it didn’t last the day. If you are playing game or doing video call then battery would drain very fast. Signal strength and wifi reception is also not very good due to old hardware.Even cheaper android phones have better wifi reception now. Camera is good but no night mode makes it weaker. And yes performance is too good but that cost your battery. To a new person who switches from android to ios, I would like to tell you that this phone gives tou privacy and security but not comfort and easiness in functionality and apps you used. Many apps which works well in android don’t work properly on ios like truecaller, blocking spam Messages,download music. Choice is your guys. For me its not worth the money. Probably high end iphones would be good but not this one."
542,4,Wonderful,Awesome product... Super fast processor.... camera is good... cool design... Red is really nice...
543,5,For those who love small screens,"Small compact package that is light and easy to use. Comfort of the Small screen is refreshing, premium feel and excellent build quality, doesn't have the gesture controls but very powerful and good camera (Day light photos are spectacular). Battery life is a day on moderate usage with occasional heating during Camera usage.

For those who need a phone that can last for 4 years but are not looking at it as a primary entertainment device."
544,3,Good,Hello Customers like me.... It would be a great choice I you are willing to present any gift to your loved ones who loves iPhone... It was my first suspense to my wife .. She told it's an amazing product...
545,5,Fabulous!,"Phone is okk battery performance is very low , performance vise apple giveing letest software pubg runs very smooth only bad things is battery end display,apple give old look to the phone a big big Bezel on top & bottom look like iphone 7 but apple is apple if u want to buy for showing status in low prize u can purchase, but if u want good phone i suggest u go for xr or 11"
546,5,Brilliant,Awesome really liked it. I have 11 pro as well and i can really assure you that it is no less. Value for money.
547,4,Good Phone,"Good Product by Apple.
Battery life is not good just like other iPhones.
Other than this things it's a complete package by Apple as far as processor and camera is concerned."
548,5,Classy product,Best for whom wants a compact size super phone. Loving it. Go for it without a second thought
549,4,Wonderful,Expected a better battery management. Looking forward to the next IOS update from Apple and hopefully they fix the battery management in that update. Everything else is super smooth. Camera is impressive. The phone feels premium. They have also improved the speakers which sounds great.
550,5,Terrific purchase,"I’m pretty much satisfied with my purchase of this phone. For all those commenting on the battery life of this phone , it gives a decent 9-10 hrs backup after a full charge which is normally acceptable if u are not a phone frenzy."
551,5,Brilliant,Very smooth functioning and battery part is average will work for 6-8 hours if you are moderate user.Camera is awesome overall worth buying and satisfied . complete package of this segment as it works on A13 bionic chip which makes performance better ...can go for it without thinking twice...
552,5,Must buy!,"I am satisfied with that great product just feel like premium, performance is very good, battery life is decent, camera nos very good so I am just satisfied with this product"
553,4,Value-for-money,Best iPhone to have in ur pocket if u r comfortable with 4.7” screen which makes it very comfortable to use. Good camera with portrait mode..love the finishing and colour..good sound from speakers..using iPhone 6/6s and want to upgrade this is good option 👍
554,4,Good quality product,"Good handy phone .. one hand use, camera - rear is good, front is not that great, performance- good fast performing, but phone gets heated while using longer time which is not expected in iPhones."
555,5,Great product,"Go for this phone, Its compact, easy to use with single hand. Calling and speakers are clear. Interface is smart. Camera is excellent. For modest users the battery will last whole day. Earpods given in box are also decent enough."
556,4,Wonderful,"It’s another excellent product by Apple. Smooth, robust and value for money. If you get it below 40k then go for it. The charger plug I received is faulty but I am sure it will be replaced by the Apple store nearby. Overall a good budget phone with Apple’s trust."
557,4,Wonderful,"Awesome experience.... faster, very good display quality, smooth touch and operation, Fantastic camera, slim and light weight. Other than battery backup everything is top notch. Liked the device very much."
558,5,Super!,A good budget phone from Apple. A powerful machine at a reduced price. Owner”s pride neighbours envy. Easy to handle and the traditional looks of an I Phone gives a feel good factor.
559,5,Excellent,"This is my first iPhone experience the A13 Bionic chip is the USP of this product. The speed and performance when compared to all the phones I previously had this one stands apart. The price in which this was offered is a safe bet instead of going to higher models for higher price you get the same experience at a lesser price. I’ll say go for it, this phone is handy and interesting to use."
560,5,Great product,I have been using iPhone earlier as well. This one is more brilliant phone with high performance speed and i love the perfect size of the phone
561,5,Wonderful,"Small, handy, cute by look but a lot more powerful from within. Worth every penny I have spent for this super smart gadget from iconic ""Apple""."
562,5,Terrific purchase,"If you are an Apple lover then go for this. I am happy with camera features when compared to 11. A13 chip gives awesome experience.

Pros
1. A13 chip gives the speed and power to the experience
2. All latest features

Cons

579,1,Did not meet expectations,I have given my Redmi note 4 phone in exchange and there was very small issue with my phone and they have taken Rs. 1800. But when I am seeing the my order it's showing that my exchange is cancelled... Your persons are doing fraud and taking phone... They are cheating and making pressure and showing some undue fault on exchange phone and trying to take money.. This is done with me today... Pls connect me and talk to me.

Fully frustrated from Flipcart & courier E Cart.
Never recommend Flipcart from today onwards

615,5,Highly recommended,"Will keep it short:

Pros:
Awesome camera
Great speakers
Blistering performance benchmarks
The Size (had been long waiting for this one)

Cons:
Decent display (not really a con)
Not that great battery life, but after optimising a lot of settings, with moderate usage it lasts almost for a day. For a power user, probably half a day.

Overall, a great bang for buck, undoubtedly."

Just go for it if bezels and small screen size doesn’t concern you. I like the screen size though, it’s not at small, it’s perfect and easily comes in hand perfectly.
if you are switching from android, initially you may not like but after few days you will know why there is so much hype about apple. I am never going back to android."

625,4,Good quality product,Phone is ok I m satisfied with this but the display was very small
626,1,Worst experience ever!,"Battery issue, it drains very fast also phone gets heated sometimes"
627,5,Brilliant,"This has been one of the best variant including features that are a mixture of the other variants of  iPhone. This 5 rating is just for the phone.

The only problem I had was the delivery of the product. I received my product after 15 days, so a lot disappointed from Flipkart services and their team. Horrible services. For flipkart services I would rate in negative.


Also majorly, a special note to people. If u feel u should not remove the plastic since it’s a new phone, I would recommend you to remove it because the plastic is covering the mic due to which u cannot listen anything. You might think u have got a defective piece. So remove that plastic to avoid further confusions. I experienced this, thus I want no one to experience. Other than that a great phone ❤️"
628,5,Terrific purchase,Amazing product. Bought for my wife and myself. We are very happy to see the performance of this phone.

632,1,Waste of money!,"Wasted Battery!
It does not even last of 5 hours of using 4G internet that too on single sim.
Apps get force closed!
Totally disappointed"
633,1,Worst experience ever!,"This was my first iPhone. After a month, my phone has stopped running. I just put the phone on charging and after an hour I saw that the phone did not start. Neither the phone was charging nor the phone was starting. I have just given the phone to the service center. Other than this the phone battery drains very quickly. So it is my opinion that buy the phone thoughtfully. I thought the quality of the iPhone is good, but after that, I have lost faith in the iPhone as well. I am very disappointed with the quality of the iPhone. It is cheap but not so cheap that it can be compromised with the quality of the phone. It has shared my own experience which has happened to me."
634,5,Excellent,"The most awaiting phone in this year,
It is handy and light , the processor is 🔥,
Perfect phone for this budget, if you want to switch to ios.

635,5,"So much to love, so little to hold❤️","So much to love, so little to hold❤️. It will be the best choice for the one who likes to have a midrange budget flagship.
The battery won’t last for a day. After unboxing, the iPhone had an 80% charge. I got nearly 3hr of screen on time. Screenshot attached.
Speakers are loud enough. The audio quality is good.
The screen is bright.
Nothing more to say, but an iPhone 8 with iPhone 11 character."

This issue has been reported the very same day... but it took 3-4 days and we were waiting for resolution... but shocked to see that ... our ticket was closed automatically stating that the issue was troubleshooted and resolved😳😲

Never expected this from Flipkart!!!"

652,5,Terrific purchase,"Writing this review after using mobile for a week.

Excellent performance comes in handy. Previous I used iPhone 11 other android smartphone. I see the same performance as that of iPhone 11. Single camera is constraint but when coming to cost. Its ok.

Mostly of the people blaming the battery, its very difficult to accomodate huge battery inside such small devices. Don't compare 1821 MAH with 3000 or 5000 MAH. For 1821 MAH its really doing good. I am getting decent battery backup almost 1 to 1.5 day with moderate usage(If you are just using mobile for taking calls and WhatsApp and little on social media, I have done some settings changes to get such backup)
you can watch 2 full movies with headset after full charge and you will end up with 25% battery juice."

665,4,Good quality product,"First of all let me tell you I am an Android user from years and still love it. The purpose to buy an iPhone was to switch for a new eco system and to experience it. It’s been only 4 days of using this device and here are my initial impressions.
Pros:
Fits in the budget.
Handy device.
Camera and display are awesome.
Good network connectivity.
Latest iOS update.
Great build quality ( its glass back so be carefull )
Performance is great.
Can handle almost everything.
And yes it’s an iPhone!
Cons:
Battery ( but still gives you an entire day with minimal to moderate usage)
Screen size
Front camera
No Face ID
Average sound quality.
I will update this after one month of usage.

So this is after one month of usage:
Great balanced ram
Battery is okayish if u are a moderate user, keep a power bank if u are travelling.
Camera could have been better as it lacks low light photography.
Overall it’s a great buy!!"

710,3,Does the job,"Writing this review after 7 months of moderate use.
Only two sentences:
Everything is okay.
Except battery. You need to charge 4 times a day or more. Not for gaming at all!"
711,5,Fabulous!,"I was very scared to order from online site.
But thankyou flipkart for keeping my trust.
The product was delivered on 3days and it was well packed.
Now about the phone it's my first iphone so I liked it from camera ,,to display to everything,, till now I didn't find any issues,, battery is enough for me.
But the screen is little but small for those who habit of useing big screen will find little bit difficult at first.
But with time it wil okay🥰"
712,2,Bad quality,"This is my 4th iPhone and 1st Made in India iPhone, rest all are Assembled in China phones.

Biggest issue I see in this iPhone is its battery. We all know that the battery backup of iPhone will be average, but this the the battery life itself is worst. In less than 6months, the battery life approaches 90%. It will hardly survive 2 years unlike other iPhone which could easily lasts for 4 years."
713,4,Worth the money,"Compact.
Lightweight.
Powerful processor.
Videography excellent.
IP68.

Battery won’t be an issue for a person who has busy work schedule & who is not a gamer."
714,5,Just wow!,Good.
715,5,Awesome,Awesome phone
716,3,Just okay,"During app calls, especially through WhatsApp, for 1hour22mins it goes down from 100% to 58% literally.

I've turned off the following
1)background internet usage of app,
2)auto brightness is off,
3)screen time is off,
4)auto lock set in 30 seconds,
5)No gaming at all, not a single time, after all this that is what I've got as a result.
If you don't touch the phone after 100%, it stays at 98% after 24hours.
This is where it sucks alot, aka battery, all good features against this dropback kills everything, kills all the good vibes.
Probably this wouldn't be the best iphone to own for the first time and that for 30k"

740,4,Worth the money,"Am not of a Iphone user being this my first Iphone, and earlier I have used Motorola one Power, Redmi 3S Prime and some of the battery efficient android phones, charge doesn’t t last much. Iphone has it’s name over battery inefficiency, so can be ignored. And since I had a screen size specific requirement, I have no regrets. Shifting from Android to IOS, is a bit messy. Overall performance of the phone is decent. I feel I paid hefty for the brand image of Apple."

749,1,Flipkart is cheating with their customers,Very bad experience with Flipkart - Even though I have provided them screenshot on the social media - they have refused to give the product along with the accessories - I would not advise anyone to order through this site.

773,5,Just wow!,"Value for money iphone ...if you are not interested camera system of iphone 11, this is the best phone your money can buy. Go ahead and buy it without any hesitation. Battery life is average which last for a day if you are heavy internet user and for a day and half of you use it for phone calls and minimum internet use.

It feels really good in hand and fits perfectly in small hands too. Can’t comment about durability of screen as far as scratches are concerned but so far so good."
774,4,Really Nice,"This is my first iphone. Bought on 21-03-21. So far its performance is good. Before buying this All i worried about was battery. But man, this is an average usage iphone mainly for non gamers. I just play chess online through app. So when i charge it for full, i am getting a decent usage for 15hrs. (Youtube, chess app, Flipkart , camera, whatsapp, phone calls, and some more normal usage apps)
Surely you can go with this. Having a power bank can save you while journeys. Overall rating is 4/5."
775,5,Awesome,Phone is excellent in every aspect. You will get used to with battery after a week. So don't think and doubt about small battery.
776,2,Slightly disappointed,There is no charging adapter provided. Very cheap experience with Apple brand for the first time.

Dude its a iphone its too good.
I was only worried about battery but it lasted more than 24 hrs. Without any games

793,4,"Authentic, Smart Performer","In Simple word, Can say WOW!!!
What a Camera, In-build Quality & Performance.
Every once says battery is a hitch, Obviously if any one perform well then their energy level drains.
Iphone SE 2020 is a super performer, So definitely energy (battery) drains. You have to charge.
Go for it"
794,5,Simply awesome,After long time i changing my iPhone 5s to SE. worth for money. I don’t see any battery problem as well.
795,5,Mind-blowing purchase,Nice mobile
796,4,Good choice,"Coming from an iPhone 6, this one feels like heaven regarding performance. Red should’ve been more vibrant.
Not for night photography. And also the image stabilisation is not good.
Valuable for money though 👍🏽"
797,5,Wonderful,Product is good.. but pay on delivery option does not accept card/paytm/googlePay payment.!! This is not very much convinience for customer. Flipkart should also implement Paytm/GooglePay option in case of pay on delivery situation.
798,5,Must buy!,"Looks outdated on the outside indeed but it’s a beast inside. Nevertheless feels premium ,Snappy processor with no lags at all."
799,5,Perfect product!,Battery work like 4500 mah and camera is awesome
800,3,Just okay,"Received iphone se 2020 after 10 long days.
Initially battery was being discharged very fast but after a day or two with some settings done everything seems ok as of now.
No comparison of other phones with iphone.
Worth a buy. Got at Rs. 38,800 after HDFC credit card instant discount.
I will purchase one more for myself and one again for my daughter"
801,5,Just wow!,"Its awesome phone and except battery , even battery also fine only , 1 day we can manage no issue at all"
802,5,Terrific purchase,"I am fully satisfied after getting the iphone se 2020in my Hand what I was expecting....
Ultimate cell phone.👍👌😍😊"
803,5,Great Purchase: Worth the Investment,"Shifted from Android to iOS.
Do not think twice before buying it. I was very skeptical initially, was confused between Oneplus and SE 2020, but i haven't regretted for a single moment.
Size is very comfortable to hold and unlike the general perception, battery does last long.
Especially for an average user( 5-6 hours of screen time) battery will never be an issue.
Also, camera quality is very good."
804,4,Good quality product,"Best phone
iPhone is iPhone
Awesome performance"
805,1,Utterly Disappointed,Phone is ok but the delivery service is bad . Packing was bad

810,5,Terrific purchase,"Received in 2 days! Excellent delivery by Flipkart! About the phone, needless to say it is an Apple. I rest my case there."
811,5,Highly recommended,Worth. Take it.
812,3,Does the job,"It’s look like iPhone 6 and when you touch the home button it’s feel hard and when you turn on speaker during call it will vibrate and even playing the candy crash, Not for worth for money, camera was good but battery was worst if you are using continuesly it will try with in 6 hours."
813,5,Worth every penny,"I’m using iPhone SE 1st gen since 5 years and was waiting for SE2 since a long time! It’s nice upgrade when you’re a fan of SE! Design, performance, interface is obvious apple standard so no need to mention anything in detail!"
814,2,Not good,"I trusted and brought this product. But this phone battery is draining very fast,even not withstanding 2 hour back up. No solution from apple product support team. This phone is waste of money."
815,3,Does the job,Wonderful performance with disgusting battery health! After 7 days use it’s showing 92% battery health. The battery lasts maximum 3 hours screen on time. Don’t buy it!
816,4,Delightful,"Amazing phone if you want to get into the ""Apple Ecosystem"".
If you need a secondary phone then it is definitely a no brainer! Just Buy!
Great IOS experience!
And yes....You have to buy a charger separately🙂"
817,4,Delightful,Nice
818,5,Awesome,Value for money
819,4,Pretty good,As usual apart from the battery the phone is worth it.
820,1,Horrible,Very Bad battery backup. Sucks to the core. Waste of money.
821,2,Moderate,I bought the phone on 6th of june.. and today is 13th june.. i am used my phone less than 1 hr on daily basis..but still its battery getting discharge fast.. nd mobile bettery health directly came to 98% jst in only 7 days... otherwise mobile is good...! Totally dispointed with an apple kindly suggest what can i do..?
822,4,Good quality product,"My first Iphone purchase..and what u get is a small screen phone and a small battery back up..Is it worth?I think..as of now yes...Camera is great,Phone works smooth,superb display. Still working out lot of things,let’s see ....some photos I clicked..it’s not all camera..the weather was stunning"
823,5,Must buy!,"My first ever iPhone.
I was planning to buy an iPhone since iPhone 3G😂😂.

Other phone may have 108mp quad cam,12gb ram,600ppi,1200nits, 6.7inch display and bla bla ....

Its not even having half of it..
It’s not just a phone it’s an iphone and love it...

Performance wise it’s a beast. Check antutu."
824,4,Pretty good,Gud
825,5,Excellent,Awesome beauty.
826,2,Slightly disappointed,"Before buy this phone... Just read the following drawback...
1.Display is the worst part of this phone, so much tiny, and not good display as Amoled. It's just an bad LCD display.
2.Battery Life too much worst. If you play pubg for 1hour It's drop 75%😭. For daily normal use, It's last only for 3.5 hour... Don't expect much from 1800Mah approx battery.
3.RAM managements is not good at all. It kill the heavy graphics application. Its not avoidable in the price range 40K.
4.I feel processor is not same as iPhone 11.Slighyly slower and not optimize for battery drain. Too quick battery drain😭
5.No NFC chip.
6.Charging Time is almost same as battery drain... Almost 2.5😭.
Pros:-.
1.Good Camera(for portrait and video recording)
2.Wireless charging and IP67
Conc.-If you buy it only apple apple logo then go for it. Otherwise go for OnePlus. Better value for money mobile."
827,5,Wonderful,Ultimate camera I click front and back camera photos and performance is also supper I compared with iPhone 8 which I used perversely 🔥🔥🔥😍
828,4,Good choice,Good prouduct and battery is very poor
829,3,Decent product,"❤️❤️❤️❤️ fantastic phone.. camera , battery life is good 😊"
830,1,Worthless,"I bought 10 days before.. battery life is just 2 hours..
Worst experience buying this phone"
831,1,Utterly Disappointed,The buyer is not genuine and harassed the customer till the end without any solution
832,1,Horrible,"Battery backup is not so good for heavy user..
If you play game like pubg then hardly this will give 1.30 hrs backup"
833,1,Very poor,"Don't buy any product from Flipkart, they are least supportive it you are in trouble with your purchase with Flipkart. Bad experience."
834,2,Could be way better,"Don’t ever switch to iPhone from Android... I hate it already.... This low cost phone is the trap into iPhone ecosystem, and never make any justification.... so much of limitations, trying to replace for Android again"
835,3,Nice,"The battery drains faster than u can imagine
Rest all features are good"
836,1,Waste of money!,Battery is very poor . It coudnt stay for full day even without using net also..If you need primary phone don't buy it.Second sim is digital sim.
837,5,Classy product,Camera quality is awesome worth for money and performance with latest A13 bionic chipset is mind blowing
838,5,Simply awesome,Lovely phone ❤️📱
839,5,Classy product,Excellent device its very premium and main biggest thing is a13 bionic chip its used in 11 pro max flagship devices too so think about the performance u can edit video by connecting adaptor usb to monitor and edit they simply smooth i used lumafusion and rendered 4k its ultra smooth ! Only drawback is battery is average and charging time its taking is worst! If you consider this 2 dont buy try alternatives.. if you compromise this its beast!!!
840,5,Super!,"Awesome, I was using iPhone XR which is large and bulky this one is compact and really fits into the hand, with all the functions of XR iphone. Battery life is the only problem. if you're heavy user watching lots of videos and playing games better don't go for it."
841,4,Wonderful,"What I liked :

Fast charging capability, charges superfast with Fast charger bought separately
Wireless charging is convenient
One hand operation
E-sim function
Always connected with Macbook
Bluetooth for speaker connectivity is long range
Phone learns user behavior quickly and adapts
Siri is very responsive and helpful at times
OS is intuitive
IP67 , not afraid of monsoon Or washroom spills


What I didnt :

Battery drains in 4-5 hours of screen use"
842,1,Unsatisfactory,It has weak cellular signals and hotspot is not strong even using multiple sims...
843,5,Terrific purchase,What a phone. It's not a just phone. It's an Art
844,5,Highly recommended,Good one
845,5,Just wow!,Good mobile
846,1,Absolutely JUNK PHONE !!!!,Worst product. Apple's quality of this product is poor by any standard. It has manufacturing defects. The sound output is bad. It is a pain to operate apple software. It is inferior to Android. Don't even buy. Its accessories are overpriced. So never ever buy an apple product. Its overhyped. It offers a quality that has deteriorated significantly over the past 5 years. AVOID !!!
847,5,Awesome,"Just go for it...
Best in the segment.Heavy performance at this price segment .
Pro’s-
Compact design
Slim
Easy to handle
Great camera
Decent battery
Fast working

Cons;;;;
Camera not upto mark in low light
Not suitable for gamers
Small display"
848,4,Wonderful,"The phone definitely is goood. Camera is excellent, the look is amazing. But it has got heating issues also the battery doesn't last long. Still, after using it for 10 good days, must say in this range, this iPhone is definitely the best!!"
849,5,Highly recommended,It's my first iphone and fallen in love with it. Now I got to know why people go crazy for iphone. If you are a normal phone user it's for you.
850,5,Terrific,"I have just switched from android to iOS. I am in love with this phone 😍 super cute, Handy, and camera is just wow 👌 battery is not so bad I have been using from 2 days. Not found so much issue. If you use it 24 hrs in game and videos it will be obvious that it will be drain rapidly. I am satisfied. ❤️"
851,5,Perfect product!,Excellent
852,1,Don't waste your money,"Screen is very delicate, My mobile screen was broken as it’s just fell down from my pant pocket"
853,1,Did not meet expectations,"I have purchased the product in the month of October, 2020. Just six months I have used the product and I take care of my phone in well manner but the phone is suddenly being shut down and near about 1 day totally it becomes in that condition.
Very bad experience of taking such a costly iPhone from Flipkart."
854,5,Awesome,Phone is very nice and looks premium but battery back up is very poor
855,5,Wonderful,I’m iphone user since I’m using any phone I haven’t buy any other phones so I love to recommend you go for it if you’re iphone user..
856,5,Wonderful,Buying the same phone for the second time. Perfomance and camera are off the charts. No other mid range has these. But the battery life is extremely low. I bought an se 1 year ago. Being a hardcore user the battery health dropped to 80% so that i needed to charge 4 times a day. Buying a power bank can solve the battery issue.
857,5,Simply awesome,"A13 chipset gives iOS room to grow.
Good battery life.
Software updates for years.
Supports fast LTE and Wi-Fi 6.
Wireless charging is a nice touch.
Great Touch ID sensor is back.

872,4,:),Awesome!!
873,4,Wonderful,"Perfect phone in terms of size and performance. Only drawback I can tell is it’s battery.Battery drains too fast if your internet is ON.
Even if you ain’t using your phone battery will last only for 6-8 hours that is injustice I guess.

879,5,Highly recommended,For the price it is coming for it offers an excellent performance cannot complain a complete package if can ignore the ips lcd screen…. Don’t know why all the guys are giving negative ratings for battery it is good enough for an avg user like me whose screen on time on an avg is 4:30 hrs everyday it easily lasts 1 complete day for me
880,5,Just wow!,Camera is wow👌
881,4,Very Good,"Every phone should include charger , how someone charge without a charger? Headphones, it is fine but charger is integral part of the phone. Such a bad way to sell accessories."
882,5,Great product,It's a great modified Phone in a very less price and it is the new phone of young generation

912,2,Expected a better product,BATTERY IS VERY WEAK
913,4,Delightful,I have been using the phone since a month or so. It’s working well since then. Battery lasts for 6-7 hours on stretch.
914,5,Must buy!,Just awesome ....I hate bezel less phones ...for people like me it's a masterpiece....its been 3 months... but unlike android phones it's still smooth asf
915,4,Nice product,"Its a steal for 20k! I got it for this price on BBD. While everything is top notch as expected of Apple with a lot of nifty features but the battery sucks bigtime. Considering I changed from a One Plus to iPhone, the battery is quite a concern."

Other than that can't complain much."
920,5,Wonderful,Amazing phone value for money 👍👍👍
921,5,Excellent,Best one for me. I don't use my phone aggressively! I take care of my gadgets well and don't compare the Apple products with Android ones. The android users and apple users have a major difference in what they want from their gadgets and I think it's really unfair to compare two different operating systems!
922,4,Value-for-money,"Switiching to iPhone from Android, you will never regret.
Touch and ownership experience is excellent, no need to go more on this everyone knows this.
Only thing is Battery Drainage
Even if you moderately use, Like you are browsing through mails, social media scrolling sometime then you need to charge twice a day.

IMPORTANT: Check carefully what you order includes charger adapter and earphones or not, the one i ordered did not include and i was disappointed, had to buy charger extra 2k INR."
923,5,Worth every penny,Camera is amazing
924,3,Decent product,"Inside box you could not get charger and head phone,
Battery is below average quality,
Other wise this phone is ok condition and good built quality"
925,3,Nice,"I am writing this after 1 month of usage, battery backup is very bad and mobile has heating issues when you doesn’t charge with apple adapter."
926,4,Really Nice,Why always poor battery apple.... an apple can energize full body... but it don't have battery i think they have taken it seriously....🤔

940,5,Super!,"If you are not into playing games on mobile and want to enter into apple environment, this is the best phone. Great camera, battery lasting for a day, and of course feel of IOS.
On time delivery from Flipkart."
941,5,Terrific purchase,"Wow! First time I felt that this is not a garbage bin but a phone. I had similar kind of experience while using windows but Android is like a lot of useless things packed. I have no issues with the phone. But there are 3 areas where it might disappoint you.
1. Display: It's not a problem for me as I seriously prefer this dispaly of iPhone notches on high-level phones. I hope we will see punch hole soon.
2. Battery: Drains a bit faster.
3. Gestures: If you are using a phones with gestures, u are going to miss that. But when u get used to it u might forget that.

In every other department it's a king especially camera.

I recommend this if you didn't find the 3 areas having much impact on you."

946,5,Worth every penny,"After using realme phone. This was awesome, good for lite user if wanna go throughout the day else a small charge is needed. Battery is the only issue here.

961,3,Decent product,Phone is good. However this is entry level phone so it must provide EarPods and charging Power adapter.
962,5,Excellent,Awesome phone beautiful sound & picture quality battery backup is aslo good little bit hiting issue but no so much felt
963,5,Best in the market!,Great phone but not for everybody. This is the best value for money device but battery life is way below average.
964,2,Expected a better product,substandard product from iphone
965,4,Good quality product,Battery backup is a bit less as compared to earlier variants that I have used but still not a big problem. Got the 128 GB phone around 28k and definitely is value for money.
966,5,Must buy!,"Very powerful and handy device, value for money.

984,5,Highly recommended,Awesome
985,5,Highly recommended,Apple at its best.. Strongly recommended....
986,4,Wonderful,"Battery backup isn’t as bad as many are reporting. If you are not a gamer, this phone should pretty much last a day on a normal usage. WhatsApp video call drains battery a lot. But i have seen that happening on Oneplus as well. So should be a general issue. Overall a nice handy phone. Must buy for people looking for a phone to use single hand."
987,5,Just wow!,"Good phone for basic use(chatting, calling, clicking few photos)
Battery drains quickly on heavy use(watching videos or gaming)

Got the 128gb version for 40k after applying offers so I felt it was worth it.

Why to spend 30k on oppo,vivo etc"
988,5,Super!,Best mobile in the market and camera is mind blowing.
989,5,Just wow!,"It is a very good phone at a very low price.
Flagship processor
Best camera
Best for those who want small phone"
990,5,Wonderful,Awesome product...
991,4,Really Nice,Poor battery management is surely a major put off - 1800 mAh is darn small in today's time when people are moving towards 6000mAh - rest of the phone is ok and does carry the apple flag but battery surely spoiled the otherwise a decent product
992,5,Best in the market!,"Just awesome experience
Small but sweet 🥰
Must go for it.
Android users can’t understand the enjoyment of The Apple."
993,4,Good choice,"Smooth performance and great camera quality.
Dual speaker sound top notch. Okayish battey."
994,5,Best in the market!,Need improvement in Battery🔋
995,4,"Good phone, except battery everything else works amazing","Very nice build quality, nice camera, exceptional performance but the only down side is the battery which is a meager 1850 mAh and doesn't last even for a day. But for the price, you are getting a premium phone none the less"
996,4,Worth the money,Screen vibrate while play songs but overall best one phone.
997,3,Nice,"Phone is good. But exchange program is not good they rejected my iPhone 6 with not even a single scratch almost new condition, for reason I couldn't understand, it's like fooling customers with exchange offers. I had to make cash balance payment to get the phone."
998,3,Just okay,"It has always been a good looking phone in hand, has been a part of one's personality, this phone has a good performance but when you talk about the features and customization it equals to a worthless metal piece.. It is good to be presented that's it."
999,1,Worthless,Within one week of purchase WiFi Bluetooth and screenshot not working
1000,4,Delightful,Camera quality is amazing and full satisfaction that you need for pictures and also works very smooth.
1001,5,Must buy!,"Once you purchased iPhone se2020,
You will never go back for Android phones.

1004,5,Terrific purchase,Gud
1005,5,Just wow!,"After so much of research and reading reviews finally took a decision of buying SE. Absolutely in love with the camera quality. If you’re on budget and want to buy IOS please go for SE. So far i haven’t faced any issue for Battery, if your useage is normal i dont think you will have a battery complain. Overall its good. Attaching a picture for reference."
1006,4,good i phone in this price,"good product , baterry low , charge 2 times in a day , camera gd, speed also well"
1007,1,Useless product,Mic is not working

1009,5,Worth every penny,Only 1 word : Awesome
1010,5,Wonderful,"really best single hand use best every thing but battery back up not good

awsome product"
1011,3,Just okay,"Well basically I bought it because of the small size and the processor, so there's not any kind of problem. But battery could have been better, I know it's a small handset so battery will be small, but the rate at which battery drains is really bad."
1012,5,Perfect product!,Just love the IPhone ...SE2020
1013,2,Moderate,Not at value for money .battery life is disaster
1014,5,Wonderful,"Compactness and packaging!
Beat that.
And about the experience of opening and using one...
You got to buy one to say about the one."
1015,3,Fair,Okk ok
1016,1,Useless product,"Not worth the price.
Have same old network antenna , network issues, call drops and many more."
1017,5,Super!,The best in class
1018,4,Really Nice,So... a lot of hype was there in Indian market regarding this model. Overall a decent phone. Maybe A12 could have been used and price kept a tad lower. A13 is not really required I think. Battery is just average. Should definitely have been better. One real problem I am noticing in three days of use is heating and simultaneous battery draining while using hotspot. 15 minutes of hotspot has drained the battery from 43% to 29% !! Along with heating. Didn’t expect this. FaceTime is heating up too a bit. As of positives? Well... iPhone users won’t find anything problematic except what I noticed as above and get back their home sweet home button. For new iOS users things would be a breeze. Go for it for an iOS experience if you want just the right sized phone. Not too big and bulky and still fully loaded.
1019,5,Great product,"This is a mini beast, It can run PUBG with HDR graphic and extreme framerate without any lag. Battery is good compared to iphone 8. This is my first brand new apple device. It's the best deal from apple ever."
1020,1,Don't waste your money,Worst performance
1021,1,Not recommended at all,Heating problem and battery problem
1022,5,Worth every penny,Nice colour.(Red). Display size should be increased
1023,1,Not recommended at all,battery is not get fully charged & cell getting too hitting too much as per value its not worth to have I phone SE 202O
1024,3,It would be a deal breaker if Mobile battery is good.,"Excellent Phone but battery life is extremely poor. If you use
whatsapp
Attending calls average of 30 minutes in a day,
Taking pictures
Completely on wifi
Use apps like flipkart etc

You get 12 hours of charging.

Apart from Charging. Camera and performance is very good."
1025,5,Simply awesome,Best in segment...✌️
1026,5,Terrific,Excellent phone. Good battery back up and display too.

My first apple product. Loved it. Value for money."
1043,5,Wonderful,Good thing liked was handy and performance u can't deny apple will update full review soon
1044,1,Not recommended at all,Phone is perfect 👍 no doubt by the main problem with this iphone is battery problem its takes about 2hrs 20 mins to fully charged from 0-100% and this Very big problem..apart from that phone is really good i just love it ..
1045,5,Super!,Best one still date
1046,4,Really Nice,"I bought this phone for my mom. And with unavailability of Pixel and urgent need of a new device, we were forced to choose iphone, since it was better placed as MVP at the moment.
Good Camera(not better than Pixel)
Good Screen(not an led,but acceptable)
Excellent Battery and Performance(without games)
Only con is that it could not transport whatsapp data from Android to ios.
This would certainly last 3-5 yrs from now."
1047,1,Waste of money!,Only thing that matters now a days is a long lasting battery. In times of now when everything is working on 4g network this phone is not a worth. PLEASE DON'T SPEND YOUR MONEY ON THIS.
1048,5,Terrific,"Beast processor, camera and overall performance. Got in 38,600. I was not sure about camera performance but I got to know that it's really nice. Good portrait mode, nice slow of 240 fps. Totally value for money."

1051,3,Just okay,"The offer price - good. The delivery schedule by flipkart and customer support - pathetic, the worst ever. The delivery personnel - courteous. The exchange process - smooth. The iphone SE 2020- budget phone - looks good, sleek. There was a problem with the volume which got corrected with the OS update.The absence of an audio port is most disappointing. So cannot use wired headphones. If that is Apple's way of promoting their air pods, then sorry - these are unaffordable for a budget SE owner !"
1052,1,Very poor,Bettery backup is very bad
1053,5,Great product,My 2nd iPhone 🥰❤️ I just love it💖
1054,5,Just wow!,"Great phone at this range (33k for 128gb). Phone is a powerhouse though it looks cute and small.
Cons - can feel vibration on screen when u play high bass music. It seems that's applicable for all slim iphones without audio jack."
1055,1,Very poor,Phone keeps turning off...it's only been a day since I bought my phone
1056,4,Wonderful,"Ph is just amazing. It works so smooth
Camera is just 👌 it has only one camera but the quality is superb. Must buy this ph you will never regret"
1057,5,Simply awesome,Writing this review after 9 months of usage. Product is working well. Only issue I felt is battery backup. It lasts only 3-4 hrs on full usage. On top of this time taken for recharge is around 5 hrs.
1058,5,Perfect product!,Nice product
1059,5,Terrific,"I have purchased around two months ago ,good experience and battery performance too good"
1060,5,Worth every penny,Every thing is Nice except battery
1061,5,Highly recommended,Overall phone was brilliant but battery was so bad
1062,3,"What an ""INNOVATION""",Bought a new iPhone SE 2 after six years of using iPhone 6. Nothing has changed except the box. Jobs will be very grateful to have a good team on board ;-)
1063,5,Super!,The camera quality is no doubt unbelievably awesome. Battery is decent you will get around 9-10 hours after a decent usage . Screen size is small but trust me it’s better than many android phones.

1069,5,Best in the market!,Excellent sexy handy mobile
1070,5,Must buy!,Great phone Great performance fully satisfied with the product
1071,5,Highly recommended,Awesome 👌👌
1072,5,Brilliant,It's too powerful to use. The only problem is its size and its battery. But I should tell you that if you are going to buy this phone for gaming purpose you should buy oneplus Nord. As it has the same price and a bigger battery and a display too. This phone heats too much when you play game. You dont get a night mode in the camera but if you focus on an item and then increase the exposure you will get satisfactory photo in night. Taking about the battery I you need to charge the phone 2 times a day if you use phone heavily (excluding games). At the end I would conclude that you should buy this phone only you are not goi g to play any game.
1073,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"Awesome phone but this bettery is not Good
But Love this iphone"
1074,4,Worth the money,"I like everything except one thing.
On flipkart site they have mentioned Country of origin is India, but on Box they have mentioned Country of Origin in China.
Why this wrong information you have shown on your website?"
1075,5,Great product,Just go for it.
1076,1,Did not meet expectations,Defective pice
1077,5,Fabulous!,I m alwys a iphone user ..Bt when iphone se has launch everyone was telling if we buy iphone se it was loss of money..aftr xperiencing the uses i m totally satisfied with dis phone great color supreb cmera build quality..battery is silghtly less bt overall experience good
1078,3,Nice,Battery backup is worst I have to charge thrice a day ..
1079,1,Worst experience ever!,Battery backup is worst..
1080,1,Don't buy if you are used to with bigger screen.,"I you were using full-display earlier, this would look outdated, the problem with smaller screen is the typing. With smaller screen you wan't get enough are to type, and bezels looks pretty bad."
1081,4,Wonderful,"Excellent camera
Processor is awesome 😎"
1082,5,Brilliant,Best phone in its price range.
1083,1,Did not meet expectations,"Worst ever product from iPhone, average camera, worst battery back up need to charge the phone twice in a day of you gets more than 30 calls in a day, no value for money...not worth buying it...."
1084,1,Don't waste your money please stay away from higly priced SE,"The product was faulty even before using it for one month. Please refrain from buying this product. Regreting the purchase. Most disappointing thing is that, for getting the service done we need to wait for one or two months and that too they are not sue wheter the product will get replaced or repaired.

Being a product from apple, we dont expect such issues which will affect the people who use the product for daily purposes.

My recomendations will be buy iphone 7 or 8 and SE dosent make any sence other than using the new processor, which is like putting a mercedes engine in a maruthi k10 car.

please dont waste your vaulbe money; if you are buying your first apple iphone invest in 7 or 8 which is similar and worry free..you wont get anything other than minor camera performance which will any way get updated with next ios upgrade; and iphone 7 and 8 supports ios 14

moreover never upgrade from iphone 6 6s 7 or 8 to SE.. you will regert your choice."
1085,1,Absolute rubbish!,WORST phone ever...... hardly 2-3 hour battery life.....no HD display..... WASTE OF MONEY....
1086,5,Worth every penny,best camera
1087,1,Terrible product,"Battery strength is very bad...
Hardly its working 12hrs after 100% charged, with very basic uses of phone.
thinking to return it."
1088,3,Does the job,"Have been using the phone for a few months now. As such phone is fine and camera is good, however there is serious issue with iPhone se 2020 regarding connecting to wi-fi, which I was not aware of before purchasing. All devices in my home connect well to wi-fi but this phone rarely detects wi-fi signal and is always on 4g. I have now found on blogs that this issue is faced by many users and have complained to Apple as well. So far no solution from Apple. Writing this comment so that other users can take informed decision."
1089,1,Worthless,Very disappointed on Headphones
1090,4,Very Good,The best budgeted iPhone till now but the battery is too bad where I need to charge 2 times in 24hrs. If ur a heavy mobile users I would not recommend this or carry ur power bank all time with u
1091,5,Worth every penny,Data cable and charger cable not working at all
1092,5,Perfect product!,"iPhone SE performance is best in ever as like every iphone, display colours, connectivity, smooth touch, sound quality etc but little disappointment with battery performance and screen/display size."
1093,3,Just okay,"This is a good looking, compact phone with amazing performance. The major drawback of this phone is the battery. It takes hours and hours for the phone to get fully charged and the battery drains out very very quickly. You will have a carry a wireless charger wherever you go with this phone."
1094,1,Hated it!,"One of the worst mobile phones I have ever used. May be inferior handsets are sold in India. One of my colleagues had also had bad experience. Even if your hand is lightly sweaty fingerprint unlock would not work. Many more clicks for simple tasks. Suddenly turns unresponsive. Migration is a headache. Unless you are in the bubble of Apple with all I prefixed products, you would have headache everyday due to compatibility issues with everything outside the bubble (eg. Windows). Battery charging and discharging takes same time. Overall not worth the money, atleast for the quality of devices sold in India"
1095,1,Horrible,"Pros..
1.Quite decent look
2.camera is something which gives you marvellous image
cons...
1.Battery back up is very low..
2. screen size is too small.
overall it is a bad choice for those who are thinking to purchase because of its low price. Go for iPhone 11. Don't waste your money on it."
1096,1,Horrible,"Don't go for this product battery is very bad.

If you do face time within 30 to 45 min battery will drain."
1097,5,Best in the market!,"Awesome
Good one"
1098,1,Don't waste your money,"The worst battery life of any smart phone that too apple to be specific.
Is total a piece of waste.
If your are expecting that this phone's battery can cover ur office time with some buffer time is totally a myth."
1099,2,Not good,"Everything in the iPhone SE 2020 is what you would expect from an Apple brand EXCEPT THE BATTERY. EXTREMELY POOR BATTERY WHICH DOES NOT LAST FOR 10 HRS AT NORMAL USAGE . For e.g. A SINGLE WATSAPP CALL FOR 30 MINS DRAINS THE BATTERY BY 30% !!!!! Its like purchasing a very good car but with very bad tires.

Would not recommend to buy this phone. Rather go for iPhone X, iPhone 11 or wait for iPhone 12"

Battery life is too good
Performance is awesome"
1112,1,Worst experience ever!,"Product not as per standard same as iPhone 6

1113,1,Waste of money!,Very bad battery life 😣😫
1114,1,Utterly Disappointed,"I am sharing my experience after using this phone for almost 1 year. The phone is good, but the battery is horrible. The charge stays a maximum of 5-6 hours."

1116,5,Great product,Nice
1117,5,Classy product,"Amazing camera and display,but battery backup is not good…performance is superb….best reasonable price while comparing the other iPhone models❤️❤️✨"
1118,3,Decent product,Overall mobile is good but battery drains very fast as compared to android mobile
1119,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"I am using it for almost 2 weeks..awesome in this price..every aspect is good..battery backup is also good not sure why battery rating in flipkart is so less..I am also a Youtuber, from that aspect this is also very worthy..overall a very good product."
1120,1,Utterly Disappointed,Battery capacity is too low. Total 100 percentage charge drains completely within 4 hours and mobile gets heated up upon usage.
1121,1,Don't waste your money,"Waste mobile please don’t waste ur money after receiving my phone battery performance is not at all good just for normal use also it will drain so fast and it’s showing return but it’s not true Flipkart will not bother about our complaint only


No use and no help

Please don’t buy"
1122,5,Highly recommended,The phone is really great but battery is very average
1123,5,Best in the market!,"It is the best phone under 30k.we have not to make any compromise in performance,camera
and display, but the battery is small.it is totally
Value for money.I recommend to buy it if your budget is 30K."
1124,5,Perfect product!,Awesome
1125,4,Nice product,It is great and the operating system is smooth as butter. I went for this phone only for its size which is comfortable and handy. I did not receive the charger and ear phones which is sad since they have stopped it for the iPhone model that launched in 2020 too!
1126,1,Hated it!,"If any one of you want to exchange your phone just dont do from flipkart this guys just cheats they want the phone in brand new condition and straight they say cant take and u cancel the order
After deleting all data u dont have option but u need to only buy so plz dont do any exchange with flipkart very bad experience"
1127,5,Terrific,"Except the battery, It's perfect.

Camera 4/5
Battery 2/5
Performance 5/5
Experience 5/5
Value for money 5/5 ( I got it for 25,999)

P.S. Not for those who are equipped with big displays."
1128,5,Terrific purchase,"Best budget iPhone
Love it 😍"
1129,5,Fabulous!,Not get datable + charger
1130,1,Don't waste your money,Battery capacity is worst!!
1131,5,Great product,"Battery drains quite faster. But without playing games and without watching online videos such as in YouTube, it gives me one and half day battery backup till date in full volume and 50% brightness configuration and along with some common modification in settings. I use it as my primary phone for official use. Till date no issues at all. Try not to charge the phone while the battery charge level is above 20 - 25%. This habit will reward you with prolong battery life."
1132,1,Worst experience ever!,"Pros
1. Fastest performing for mid range users
2. Camera quality is so good

Cons
1. Battery is draining so fast for moderate usage itself.

Bought this mobile in big billion days
Flipkart has cheated saying its a deal but the mobile has come without charger and headphone..

Flipkart is always fooling the customers in this way only saying it is a big billion day"
1133,1,Hated it!,"While buying it was written that earpod and charger are the part of this package . But no charger and earpod was in side the box not it was delivered in separate other box . It,s pathetic that you need to spend another 10 k to buy more . Feel cheated and thinking to return it . No support was also give from flip cart.. no phone call is received from them even after contacting them through chat . Very unprofessional"
1134,1,Terrible product,No Charger or headset in the box
1135,5,Just wow!,Good
1136,1,Absolute rubbish!,This piece of garbage gets too Damn hot. I contacted flip kart for a refund and they're now saying that I should contact apple for a 'replacement'. I want a refund... Not a replacement. Overheating piece of trash
1137,5,Wonderful,My first iphone 🥰 value for money
1138,3,Does the job,I love it
1139,1,Horrible,Phone battry very bad only 2-3 hours screen and when charging phone is very hot and very small screen donot play games pubg
1140,4,Wonderful,"A13 bionic is very fast.
Cream smooth gaming experience
Battery drains a bit while gaming
No charger, no headphone
Cable recieved is USB C type to Lightning"
1141,5,Excellent,"My first i-phone, total value for money phone. Awesome camera, performance is top notch. I love it 🔥❤👌"
1142,5,Classy product,Nice Flipkart delivery experience. Was skeptical to order online. But it turned out to be a good deal @28k for SE 128GB
1143,1,Horrible,Battery backup very very poor
1144,5,Terrific,"After a week’s usage, the phone is really good and fast. Battery life is good as it lasts for a day easily for average users (screen time of about 6.5 hours for 100% to 2%)."
1145,1,Absolute rubbish!,Touch isn’t working. I don’t know whether this a product glitch or Flipkart has compromised on the standard of the product.
1146,5,Highly recommended,The iPhone ever launched by Apple under affordable price ... without any hesitate buy it u will not regret!!!
1147,4,Very Good,"Good phone, nice display. Value for money. Slightly heavier than my old iPhone 7"
1148,5,Worth every penny,"This is my third one , First one X 64 GB , second one xs 256 gb
Every day full charge will work till evening
Compact one , fit in the shirt pocket
Speaker ok
Display compare XS is good"
1149,3,Decent product,"Battery is the problem. The problem is with the iPhone SE 2020. It gives not so good battery back up, which means it can't run whole day on a single charge. This phone is not recommended for heavy users. Put it to charge before you sleep, average usage throughout the day and battery will be around 20% by the time you sleep. Always carry a power bank just to be on the safer side."
1150,5,Awesome,Very good product
1151,4,Pretty good,Nice for those who love compact . And it's performance is amazing. The skin I duyed seperately.
1152,3,Does the job,everything else is good but the battery backup is very very bad. i will suggest not to buy this product
1153,1,Very poor,not nice with product and returnable
1154,5,Classy product,Good phone in low budget only battery backup is not upto the mark kindly resolved this issue.
1155,4,Good quality product,"Nice small screen phone
Works smoothly and battery last for a day of normal use
But it charges very fast, so no issues with battery"
1156,1,Not recommended at all,Worst battery backup
1157,2,Not good,Battery is not getting charged fully. The maximum limit which it reaches is 80%. Highly disappointed.
1158,5,Mind-blowing purchase,Premium iPhone
1159,1,Waste of money!,Battery backup is worst. Won't recommend it.. even for a moderate users. Better go for any other iPhone or Android phones.
1160,1,Terrible product,Damage product received in flipcart
1161,5,Awesome,"While you can't go wrong with an iPhone, this one is a beast in a small package. The performance blows the mind off. The Camera is one of the best. Especially at this price.
The only con would be those thick bezels and the mediocre battery but if you are not constantly surfing or doing power tasks, it lasts you the day.
Overall you can't go wrong or hate this unless you hate Apple in general."
1162,5,Classy product,"Hi
It Is an great product but comparing to my old phone battery is draining quickly and also charging is slow but if you buy 15 V charger charging will become faster."
1163,5,Mind-blowing purchase,Though it took time more than expected for the delivery but 2 days before so thankyou flipkart. Wait was worth it and the phone is a supera deal at this price criteria for that status symbol Apple logo on you phone.

1176,5,Super!,Nyc
1177,1,Worthless,"If you’re a middle class person thinking of spending your hard earned money on buying iPhone, then DON’T buy it. My family and my iPhones have severe battery issues after iOS 15 updates in less than 4 months of purchase with no heavy apps nor heavy usage. Apple does not help upon complaining and their support team don’t even call back upon assuring us that they’ll call, they’ll keep you going in circles. Don’t waste your money on Apple."

Apple is trying to fool us by providing such a waste product. I've selected this for its concise form factor and camera quality with apple's brand value.

I like it very much
Only one thing I miss in is no call recording"
1295,5,Worth every penny,I was an android user in the past decade. Thought of switching to iPhone. The experience that you get is premium and classy. Go for it. Battery backup is great for a 1820mAH battery.

Overall it is excellent ."

1298,5,Classy product,Very impressive 👏
1299,5,Best in the market!,This is the perfect phone for working from home. Its small screen ensures you don’t get distracted with social media or video streaming apps. The limited battery capacity is offset by being home and charging anytime. Would recommend if you don’t intend to be on the phone for too long.
1300,5,Excellent,If you are a student than go for it.It will save your precious time.
1301,3,Decent product,"Battry backup is very bad...otherwise perfect .plz anyone suggest me an adaptor,which adaptor is better 5w,12w,18w,20w and where to buy it?"

1343,5,Best in the market!,"Best iPhone for this price…as it is small device definitely it has average battery life but u will love it , because of performance and camera"
1344,5,Highly recommended,Supb mobile it was my first iPhone it’s touch is brilliant I love that mobile ....
1345,5,Super!,"Still keeping the same identity of iPhone when it came to existence. That’s why many folks still buying it:-
Round touchdown button
Small size and screen, handy to fit in and operable by just one hand
Light weight
Premium looks
Most important thing is budget so even a normal salaried person can buy it easily with EMI"
1346,4,Good choice,"This review is after a day of use
It is small,powerful and handy!!! Works very smooth..the biggest problem is the battery!!! I am a non gamer hence it won’t impact much for me but those who prefers playing games should really give a second thought! Overall it’s satisfying"

The vibrations,haptic engine and even the sound from the speaker is really nice. Even thought the phone is small it does everything extremely well.

But bad service by Flipkart
During search for the entered shows iphone se with earpods and adaptor
But on adding to cart it updates to iphone without adaptor and earwigs
And shockingly both are priced the same
It advertises the one with accessories and mentions it
But the does not mention about the price without these accessories
Comes with lighning cable which is type C. So you have to but the expensive adaptor as you are left with no choice
Had to put in 1900 for the original adaptor and 900 for 3.5mm jack

Excellent phone no doubt but Flipkart being the sole seller on online platform for iPhone se BAD Marketing"

1573,3,Good,"Undoubtedly great phone
But bad service by Flipkart
During search for the entered shows iphone se with earpods and adaptor
But on adding to cart it updates to iphone without adaptor and earwigs
And shockingly both are priced the same
It advertises the one with accessories and mentions it
But the does not mention about the price without these accessories
Comes with lighning cable which is type C. So you have to but the expensive adaptor as you are left with no choice
Had to put in 1900 for the original adaptor and 900 for 3.5mm jack

Excellent phone no doubt but Flipkart being the sole seller on online platform for iPhone se BAD Marketing"

1634,1,Hated it!,I am into an apple ecosystem. This is the worst apple product which I have purchased till date. Somehow this phone is not apple to give fast internet speeds from same router to which all my devices are connect even if I disconnect rest. Frequent losing connections smaller ranges and many more issues. I am sure about the quality of apple products but septic about the quality of platform and its sellers. Might be a refurbished or defective import being sold as new. Dont know just a speculation derived due to frustration.
1635,5,Best in the market!,1st apple mobile loved it
1636,5,Awesome,Best phone
1637,3,Fair,charger and earpods not included.

CONS
BATTERY LIFE

1669,5,Worth every penny,Product is amazing ❤
1670,1,Unsatisfactory Never buy anything from Flipkart. My Last.,Never buy anything from Flipkart. Apple product standard is as is. But Flipkart is simply ridiculous & 3rd class place to buy. It had shown that on exchange policy minimum it will pay back 1400 in return of iphone 6 even if glass has scratch or touchscreen is not working. But these bogus platform does not do what it shows. The delivery boy came & have not exchanged with the old phone saying glass has scratch & half of touchscreen is not working. Instead he forced to pay exchange value of Rs 3000. Even on cancellation these fraud platform is saying it will charge extra money on cancellation of EMI. This is the last product I am buying from Flipkart. I will never ever buy any other product in my lifetime from Flipkart. Such a cheap bogus platform that it can not match what it shows and what does. Beware of Flipkart.
1671,5,Simply awesome,love this phone

1673,5,Great product,"Awsome product i m very happy because this was my fist i phone in my life, 😍😁"

1682,5,Brilliant,Nice camera
1683,5,Must buy!,Verry good iPhone se
1684,1,Utterly Disappointed,No issues iPhone. The one star is due to the purchase experience in Flipkart. The item was purchased on exchange. However the Flipkart representative gave all kinds of reasons why the phone should not be exchanged and asked for difference amount. Hence a horrible experience. Not likely to return to Flipkart due to this..
1685,4,Nice product,Best in performance

1710,4,Wonderful,"The motherboard was dead within 5 days of using. But, Apple sent me a replacement. That was great from Apple's side. Delivery was great, on time. Just the motherboard issue really scared me. The black colour is dope. Double tap at the back to take a screenshot is a good addition, better than nothing. Fingerprint thing has a real bug, if anyone, other than u, touches the home button even once by mistake ,while you set up ur fingerprint, he can open it. That's how I was able to open my brother's iPhone.
iMessage lacks animoji because of no face id but have memoji.
Battery life is good.
Not flexing, but iPhone just works."
1711,4,Pretty good,Performance is stunning except battery. Battery hardly last for continuous calls of 3-4 hours. As This is second mobile for me I am happy but if this is going to be your primary one think twice before you buy or buy along with powerbank.

If your are looking for more battery performance, dot buy iPhone SE2020"
1715,5,An Excellent Phone,"A nice phone from Apple. Surprisingly, the country of origin is China. You will get an option to update phone software to iOS14.

1716,5,Terrific purchase,awesome phone worth it to buy.
1717,3,Just okay,"Bad decision, rather compromise to buy a dated iPhone which looks like any old used iPhone 5, ordinary looks,.9-4 battery job. Apple must have put in recycled components from older unsold recalled units. Abandon the idea or regret."

1806,5,Excellent,Highly recommended
1807,5,Awesome,Nice phone but battery is low quality
1808,4,Good choice,"For the price of 35780 INR post HDFC offer, I believe the all new iPhone SE 2020 is a good ""secondary device"".

There's absolutely no way you can use it as a primary phone as the battery is a huge bottleneck.

It's an iPhone that nails all the basics apart from a small bottleneck in form of network strength. For some strange reasons wifi network reception is underwhelming (slower wifi card).

Conclusion: Not recommended."

1871,5,Great product,Great value for money
1872,5,Simply awesome,"May end I decided to but this phone ! But I did research for one month and finally bought in last week on June. I have been using this device now more than three weeks. So I can give my two cents here.

Note: I am a moderator user. I spent 70% of mobile time on YouTube. Then browsing, what’s app and others. I play basic games such as sudoku, call break games. Hence my usage is moderate level.

I love this phone. Everything is perfect. I know you are looking here about battery. My straight answer is it’s very good as per my usage. I will give 4.5/5 to battery. It’s small but do remember so does everything. It’s a lcd screen i.e no oled, hence video play use less battery. Only thing I faced a bit of issue is battery consumption on video call. For 1.5 -2 hour battery drains near by 50-60% but again that’s fine. Who talks that much ?

Approximate Reference of battery from 100 to zero percent from my experience.

- Prime videos : 2 movies easily in one charge
- prime videos : 5-6 episode of 45 minute each
- YouTube - I watch cricket videos for 1-2 hours. Battery drains by 30% appx


Who should buy it: if you are someone who had never spent more than 30k on phone and now looking to take Apple. Go for it. Just order it.

Who should not buy it :
-if you are already an phone user who been using any set above I phone 8. No need to choose this. Go for 11. Tum logo pehle hi bhot ameer ho. Tum rehne do yeh!

- if you are a hardcore gamer. Avoid it. If you play pub g once in one charging set, then yes you can think."
1873,4,Really Nice,"The screen seems to be so little when compared to modern day devices , otherwise the phone is really powerful and has a decent camera"
1874,4,Wonderful,Overall phone is good but battery is draining off very fast. one need to charge twice daily after 6-8 hours.
1875,4,Battery will be product killer,"It is my iphone, loved every aspect of design and performance. However bad battery life kills the overall experience. It is like retrofitting a Mahindra E2O battery on Tesla Model S P100D, there is a constant anxiety on the battery."
1876,5,Fabulous!,"Every one is talking about battery So according to me
I played asphalt 9 for 4 hours and watch movie online 2 hours and then battery dropped to 21%from 97% and i did this work continuously and i dnt felt any heating problem .
Charging time is queit descent for me it takes 1.5 hrs to charge 97% from 15%.
So according to me is worth .
Thank you"
1877,5,Perfect product!,everthing is good but battery is poor
1878,5,Perfect product!,"First I was planning to Buy iPhone 11.
But thought logically the use I am doing for phone.
Its just compromise in camera and display size.
Being I am regular camera users and not so big fan of large screen mobile.
This the perfect combination of performance and cost effective product!!!"
1879,5,Fabulous!,"I have been using this phone for last one week. It's just awesome. Power packed. The only negative part is the batterylife. Even though, it lasts for a day if there are only normal usages. But the phone is simply great. It's just small and cute."

1881,5,Super!,Best
1882,5,Mind-blowing purchase,Excellent
1883,5,Wonderful,Such a beauty. iPhones are a class apart . The best part of it is that without spectacles able to read out even the finest texts which otherwise is impossible in other phone displays. Clarity is out of the world with premium feel.

Want to see a service centre soon on this.
However the phone as a whole is good, but battery is a really big pain."

Battery- 2/5"
1893,4,Really Nice,Everything is top notch except battery. Charge will drain very soon even for moderate usage.

Delivery. Mobile doing very well working. Camera is Excellent. Camera sensor have ISight 8 CMOS BSI SENSOR GIVES VERY DETAILED IMAGES & videos. Other features also perfect."
1895,2,Moderate,"Battery is a big time issue in this one. Phone is not having many apps in it by default so you will have to install all by yourself. Bluetooth is active in my handset but sending and receiving files is not happening. File management is not good in this version as no file manager installed. Screen display is very small. No SD card slot. It says it’s dual SIM but second SIM has to be an e-SIM, doesn’t solve the purpose. Not having any great features. All in all okay okay product."
1896,5,Brilliant,Amazing iPhone at the best price.. amazing battery life and latest OS.
1897,5,Terrific purchase,Super
1898,3,"Decent product! Budget Buy, Finally Apple Brand New Phone","Good Things to mention after 15 days of use:
Status iKon.
Display
Camera
Weight
Processor (Excellent- Same as that of Apple 11 Pro)
Safety features of Phone
Double Sim with one e-sim option
Price

Poor Aspects:
Phone Battery (only 1800 mAh). Yes, this is not a printing mistake...!!! You need to charge again in evening once you charge it in morning fully.
Single Processor: You can have only one call at a time. This means if you are talking with someone on One Sim card then your other Sim card will show out of Network.

Only two Disadvantages but are very big and it feels while use.

If they doesn't matter to you, then please go ahead without having any second thought. Hence, I am giving 3.5 Stars."
1899,4,Really Nice,"Everything is just right amount in the phone , the phone just lags in one department i.e Battery . If the battery would have been 3000mAh , the product would have been the best flagship phone killer of this time."

1921,5,Must buy!,Compact and powerful phone with average battery life.
1922,5,Highly recommended,"Perfect phone for those wanting to upgrade from iPhone 7/8 and or its previous predecessors. The only issue is there isn’t a night mode on the camera which, most of the android competitors have in this price range and the battery could have been slightly better."

6,4,Wonderful,"Let’s keep it simple, Phone is damn smooth and if you are coming from Android, you will really notice the difference no matter which smartphone you used earlier. Pros: 1. Camera and image processing (portrait modes) 2. Battery (7hrs screen on time) i.e. all day battery life 3. iOS (If you are coming from Android, you will need 2 days to get used to it.. like gestures and all but once you are into it, there's no way turning back. Animations are refined and you will enjoy them) 4. Face ID is super fast and 100% secure 5. Performance is superior to most Android smartphone in market as of today in this price bracket. A12 it is !! 6. Speakers are excellent 7. Haptic feedback is next level. I can't explain in words.. in short it feels like someone is sitting inside and knocking phone's display 😂😂  Cons: 1. Glass back costs half price of phone itself if in case you end up shattering it 2. Phone is heavy.. 194 grams to be precise and when you add screen guard and back cover, it will add up and finally be around 210~230 grams 3. Battery charging is slow. Like what else will you expect from a 5w charger. 4. Front camera res is 7MP and will give you consistent results for 95% of time but for rest.. be prepared for some horrible selfies 😂  See, if you think that you are ok with a camera performance of 4/5, then blindly go with this phone. And if you are one who has camera as #1 priority then you must go for iPhone 11, it has better cameras.  Pro Tip: Don’t judge it’s display and camera based on just on paper specs and numbers. Both are excellent and 99% people won’t have any problem. One more thing.. if possible go with a 128 gigs variant. iPhones eat lot of space !!"
7,4,Wonderful,😍😍 My 1st iPhone and really i love itt.... I moved android to iOS and its very good experience .. new gui and new things.specially i love 😍 the display...
8,4,Pretty good,"So amazin....Blue colour is fresh+beautiful+awesome . And For me it's so ooooo pretty & fancy colour . Wow! Phone features , COD tho 👍, price value perfect , full screen wallpaper hd for mobile and about battery life i can't describe . Aaaaaa.......lovely. And im Sorry for my photography but in real blue colour is so amazin , i meant it 🖖."
9,5,Best in the market!,"Best ever from Iphone  this is my first apple device and i’m very glad that i bought this instead of OnePlues 7pro The phone has awesome battery backup, sound quality,style , and camera"
10,5,Great product,It’s a perfect compact phone Great performance a12bionic chip camera quality is very good at daylight but poor quality in low light. Display is quite good no issues. And at the end of the day it’s IPhone. So you should go for it. And yes privacy is extremely superb Thanks that’s all it’s my opinion.
11,5,Highly recommended,"I have bought the 128GB Product RED version. Being an Android user, it was a different hands-on experience of the XR and Iam really liking it. Display looks great, sound quality is great, camera quality is good and mainly the gaming performance is so smooth and fast and never felt a single frame drop ever.  Even though its costly for an ""Budget"" apple iphone, it's worth the money I have spent on this mobile."
12,5,Terrific,"Great value for money iphone. All rounder. Still a champ to give a stiff n best fights to many same range flagships. Need an iPhone. Go for it. Good hardware, better with the camera, battery life is can be managed with a day average plus usage. Rest this is not a beast but surly neither a general 1..it got all that you need in a good 1..so in 2021 if this is ur last stretched budget, then blindly choose this as yours."
13,5,Terrific,"Frankly speaking I was hesitating to place order online for such huge amount phone but the exchange facility, committed delivery time and the packaging is absolutely fine. Thanks to Flipkart. Talking about the phone - I switched to iOS for the first time. I am One plus lover but I didn’t want to pay to Chinese product hence got this amazing made in California and assembled in India product. Smooth touch, ease of handling and good battery life is giving nice experience. Value for money!"
14,5,Classy product,"Once again , very very happy with the product. 100% genuine and timely delivery. Thanks a lot flipkart. Happy to shop from here. Highly recommend everyone to go for this product. Worth buying."
15,5,Fabulous Product. Love It.!,"The phone has a supreme build and a sturdy feel in hands. Coming from a 6S, I felt it was a bit too wide, but It’ll grow on you. The RED is by far the best color among available. And this one is an absolute battery champ and won’t let you down. Charging is also pretty fast if you use a fast charger. I use an iPad 12W charger to top it up and it goes from 10% to 90% within 90 mins. If we take in the factor of longevity of the iPhones (iOS support and updates for atleast next 5 years), this is definitely worth it."
16,4,Very Good,"After using android for 10 yrs m, i moved to iOS and i must say its very difficult to find n use iPhone...i will come to this later , let me start with features: nice camera but not better than samsung note 8.. display bright n good .. nice sound and very good look... a bit bulky...  What irritates me :  1. Setting ur fav song as ringtone: torture to do that... 2. 90% of good app either wallpaper or ringtones or utility: are paid.. 3 iCloud only 5gb.. 4. Not able to migrate chrome bookmarks here so far 5. Not sure why select all doesnt work either on msg or whastapp or anywhere 6. Default charger takes arnd 4 hrs to full charge 7. Sound is good n default headset gives good sound  Struggle everywhere for android users...  Last but not least, love to have an iPhone .  Thanks"
17,5,Best in the market!,Writing a review after one month use Go for it it’s a great product Flipkart is best❤️ The cameras are really super super Great plus the video quality is really sharp
18,5,Awesome,"I have been using it from last 4 months and are fully satisfied with it. I had purchased it from flipkart and everyone knows that its price is much higher compare to the android phone having almost same features. But everything on an iPhone is premium . Looks great in Corel colour, battery last for full one day. Camera is awesome. Although display is not LED but still it looks great. Sound quality is great. No fast charger in the box may be a con. No heating issue at all,high end games works smoothly."
19,5,Super!,"Awesome IPhone. My first IPhone. Am very happy 😃 IOS 13.6(updated) Battery one day Display good enough Camera awesome, uploaded some pics Performance awesome, No lag in PUBG. Also having 3D Touch which is awesome. Overall Full pack, love it 😍 Thanks Apple Thanks Flipkart"
20,5,Wonderful,"Awesome ❤️. Just go for it. I am very happy with my decision for buying XR instead of iPhone 8 Plus, X, XS and XS Max. Here are the comparisons among these models which made it easy for me to decide to buy this iPhone  Screen: 1. This iPhone has HD screen but others have full HD. Still it doesn’t disappoint me while watching full HD video. 2. Perfect screen size, Not too big(8 Plus, XS Max) and Not very small(iPhone X or iPhone XS).  Design: 1. All these models (except 8 plus) have new iPhone design which looks good and similar.  Camera: 1. iPhone Xs, Xs Max and XR have same camera quality which are better than X and 8 Plus. iPhone XR has only one Rear camera and others have two. But the picture quality is still better than X and 8 Plus.  Performance, features and other specs: 1. iPhone Xs, XS max and XR have better performance compare to X and 8 Plus. Among all these models iPhone XR has longer battery life. 2. iPhone XR may have got some one or more less features compare to Xs, XS max, but those are really not necessary to have. 3. In term of performance iPhone XR are similar to XS and XS max. And better than X and 8 Plus.  Price: 1. Little higher than 8 Plus but with new design, good camera and good performance I am ok with price and Price is still lesser than X, XS and XS max."
21,4,Really Nice,"I received my phone packaged properly and there were no issues with delivery. Now coming to the phone, I would like to rate it 4 stars.  Camera - Decent camera but there are much better camera out there for the price. This camera is good for 2018 phone but outdated for 2021 phone. If you like to click macro shots of flowers, insects then it might be better to look elsewhere. Landscape and portrait photos are excellent.  Battery - Great battery backup and would easily last a day for an average user or may be a little more. I use 10w ipad charger and it charges the phone to 80% in about 30-35 mins. Phone heats up while fast charging but that’s how it is with most phones  Display - Its LCD, should have been OLED at this price but hey, its not bad by any standards. The touch is something cannot be “copied” by the Chinese phones, its smooth, haptic feedback is great.  Speaker - Good speaker, its loud but bass could have been better. You need high quality audio to play it at full volume otherwise it may produce static. Overall it is satisfactory.  Hardware - A12 chip with 3GB ram works flawlessly even in 2021, there is no lag of any sort while multitasking or using heavy apps although the phone heats a little but nothing alarming. You can play any game of your choice provided you have enough juice in battery.  Should you buy it? Yes, if your priority is brand, build quality, IOS, business usage and you are careful with your gadgets(dropping it might cost you a bomb) then this phone will easily outlast any other android phone in the price range.  And No if your priority is Camera, customisations, very heavy usage, hardcore gamer because there are better phones available with new gen hardware out there."
22,5,Terrific,"1) Awesome Display - Yes i had done lot of research and people out there were saying about it pixel density, but in reality when you hold this side by side to any phone you will be surprised how good the phone actually is. 2) Speed - It is just super duper speed, you will be surprised to see that it handles 30-40 apps without tiny lag 3) Camera - Though it has single lens, it is far better than those andriods having 48MP's. 4) Battery - This is big advantage of buying this phone as it has LCD display, it wont dry your battery like IphoneX does. 50% charge moderate use you will get full day. 5) Colors - I thought of buying Red one but at the time of buying it was not on HDFC offer so bought my all time favourite Black. But next day Red was on offer - but i am happy though."
23,5,"Just wow!, Great phone for new iPhone users","Excellent Product, Great fast delivery. it's my first iPhone and I switched from android to iPhone user and I am feeling super fast and smooth experience really great phone in the price segment and as an apple product. I love it"
24,5,Great product,"I feel as if the people who gave the iPhone XR low ratings either didn't know what they were getting or didn't do research. I did a lot of research about the XR by watching a lot of Youtube videos of what the XR had to offer and the changes made from the previous iPhone models. The first thing is that the XR doesn't have a Finger Print Home Button, instead it uses Face Recognition to unlock it or a Pin Code. Second thing is that the Control Center has moved from swiping up from the bottom to swiping down from the top right corner. Third thing, it doesn't have 3D Touch, but now has Haptic Touch which doesn't bother me since I've never used the 3D Touch on previous devices. Fourth, since there's no Home Button, to close an app you'll need to swipe up from the bottom. Fifth, to do a screen shot you'll need to hold down the sleep/wake up button on the right side of the phone plus the volume up button located on the left side of the phone. Sixth, to turn the phone off completely you'll need to hold down the sleep/wake button plus the volume down button, then slide the slider to the right. Seventh, the screen resolution is lower compared to my previous iPhone 7 Plus, i can honestly say that i can't tell the difference. Eight, the camera is a single lens compared to the dual lens on the iPhone 7/8 Plus, it still takes great pictures though. It took getting used to with the new features. All in all in very happy with my iPhone XR. So what it comes down to is If you prefer the Home Fingerprint Button and 3D Touch then stick with an iPhone 8 Plus or below, if you like the dual lens camera then stick with the 7/8 Plus, If you're one of those people who can't live without a headphone jack then stick with the iPhone 6s Plus and below. I hope my review helps you with your decision to whether to get the iPhone XR or not. Oh yeah one last thing, the battery life on the iPhone XR is amazing!"
25,5,Brilliant,"Shifted from iPhone SE to XR .....a sea change . The Camera both front and rear are amazing with fantastic editing options . The Face ID makes unlocking phone apps etc so smooth , the size is also just right ...anything bigger than this should be called tab . The screen resolution is good . I am enjoying my iPhone XR,"
26,5,Brilliant,One of the best iphone i come with android background but this is marvellous very smooth camera is too good far better then one plus nor 7 plus 8 plus and Se . Best bettry back up . Wonderfull exprience .
27,5,Highly recommended,"I’m upgrading from iPhone SE, the things i liked in iPhone Xr is Brilliant super bright display Great performance Good battery backup Good cameras Bigger screen  Thing I don’t like It is much heavy. I feel the wight. Bezels are a bit thick No HDR video support for display No gigabit LTE as in Xs or Xs max 3GB RAM compared to 4GB in X, Xs, Xs max No 3D touch - even iPhone 8 and 8+ has 3D touch Blacks looks greyish in the dark No finger print scanner Basic android features are still missing in iOS. They say it is for privacy and security. It is like putting me in jail for my security."
28,5,Awesome,Awesome phone. Its my 2nd iPhone XR. Still best in 2020. Much better than iPhone 11. Thanks flipkart for this special offer. Many Many thanks to Apple for make this beautiful device. Its far better than Android
29,5,Worth every penny,Excellent Product!!! Pros : + Long lasting battery + Flawless portrait mode (front and rear) + Dual sim support + Price is Worth Cons : - No OLED display - No Full HD - Bit heavy  Caution: There are few smudges/stains on my screen which are not getting cleaned. However there is no functionality impact nor it’s visible until you see in tilted. Currently I am following up with Apple care to get it fix.
30,5,Great product,"Going to buy XR ?? If you are a iPhone lover and wanna get iPhone in budget then go for it. XR has massive performance , good camera , battery backup is sufficient for one day if your use is normal otherwise you need keep a power bank in your down pocket. All over XR is better then any other phone is this range."
31,5,Just wow!,Awesome phone good performance plus good cameras totally satisfied I have used this phone from last seven days and I observed battery back up is also good
32,4,Wonderful,"Xr is good but it can be better.  If you ever use phone which have “Amoled” or “Oled” display then you got to know difference otherwise its a great phone with great camera(no night mode and wide angle), performance, and battery( twice charge if you are a phone addict, normal user can get around 2 days without charge).  And also good for people who switch from android recently."
33,5,Best in the market!,"It is really cool . This iPhone XR is really good and cheap also . Are you looking for a good phone ,good battery life , good performance, good camera, videography then look or go through it .❤️❤️"
34,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"Excellent battery backup, Stunning camera,Premium looks.. Thank you FLIPKART for such fast delivery.. A worthy cause for purchasing an iPhone Xr.. Awesome 👍🏻"
35,5,Wonderful,it's a fantastic way to manage your communication very smartly with awesome Smooth touch...it's an amazing experience to use iPhone
36,5,Worth every penny,"One of the best(so called budget) iphone ever... Awsome build quality. Every one complaining about the screen, yes it's an lcd display with HD resolution but it's not that bad, it's a good display very bright & colour accurate. The camera of this phone is just awsome, sound quality is very good(thanks to the stereo speakers) & performance is too good A12 bionic is dazzling fast. Only disadvantage's are, no portrait mode for object's & the bazels are thicker than it's bigger brother. Overall I'm totally satisfied."
37,5,Worth every penny,Terrific purchase with amazing battery life. Single and powerful camera. No need to spend 20k extra for dual camera. Display should be 1080p. Value for money with amazing performance. Soes the job. Battery backup is awesome. Migrated from android to ios
38,5,Excellent,super camera outstanding processor but battery life is not better nice phone like it
39,5,Terrific,Best phone in 2021 from apple. I bought this in October 2020. The seller is very reliable and punctual of time for delivery. I am doctor by profession and very much happy with this product and bought two iPhone XR from the same seller. No regrets and thanks to my friend for recommending me this iPhone instead of iPhone 11 and 12. Thanks to flipkart.
40,5,Super!,"I was in a dilemma, whether to buy or not coz I was using android for a long time wanted to upgrade it, I went through the reviews of I have never seen these much of positive reviews for a single Product. So I thought of giving a try. It's worth the wait, till now I haven't found even a single flaw. I am just loving it.🤩"
41,5,Excellent,I am really happy with this product. Switching android to iOS is proving a very good decision. Loved it. Thanks Flipkart💕
42,5,Terrific purchase,"Apple I Phone XR Really Nice One, worth for the money, loved it. Thanks to Flipkart for fast delivery!"

44,5,Worth every penny,"The best mid-range iPhone. The overall performance is excellent. The screen size is perfect, neither too small nor too large. Gesture control is amazing. Face ID is extremely fast. Battery life is sufficient for full day use. Highly recommended for people who are upgrading from iPhone 8 or lower."
45,5,Highly recommended,Best phone ever even best model in apple iphones battery beckup is soo good and phone size is also awesome
46,5,Perfect product!,It’s amazing camera preformance It has a fine battery backup It’s display is cute good Rest all proformance is amazing..

50,5,Wonderful,Great phone at Great Price point.. Most affordable iPhone.. loved it
51,5,Highly recommended,"After using for 6 months, I would just like to say that after using iPhone, u would not like android again. Specially talking of iPhone XR, this is the first iPhone with excellent battery backup, camera, usage and sound."
52,5,Great product,"Got the 128 GB Variant at 41,999 in offer and I must say this Device even after 2 Years matches up the processing speed of iPhone 11 & 12 one could not feel any processing speed difference in Day to day use. Processing, Battery, Camera works Phenomenal on this Device. If your budget is tight but want to buy an modern looking iPhone .. Just close your eyes and go for it. You will not regret for sure!!"
53,4,Very Good,"Looks are great. The UI is really smooth and lag free. Due to absence of useless gimmicky features, its easy to use. Great cameras. Good display. Really a great device. On top of all, Apple assurity!! Updates, stability, virus/malware free."
54,5,Must buy!,Awesome Working... But internet speed is low. Battery backup only 1 day. Without internet 2 days.  It is working very brilliant. Camera is outstanding like video & Photo shoot camera.❤️
55,5,Brilliant,Its not cheap iphone it is a affordable iphone with decent camera nad good battery with execellent apple tech.. worth buying in 2021
56,5,Super!,Very nice phone nice camera nice display super duper mobile
57,5,Pretty Good,"I am new to the apple scene and I gotta say I picked an awesome phone to start with. I know it is 2 years old but I bet neither the camera or the processor is outdated. It can keep up with most other bran new smart phones which was released this year.  I am writing this review after almost 1 month of use.  Display: I don't see any problem in this LCD. It is very accurate and I barely feel the need for an OLED. Battery: I get backup for a whole day with around 6-7 hrs of screen on time . Camera: Like I said it keeps up with the meta even after 2 years. Looks and quality: Well I don't have to say anything yea? The build quality is amazing and each time I remove the back case, it is a beauty to behold."
58,5,Perfect product Must Buy Device,"1.Display 4.5/5 2.Camera 4.5/5 3.Audio quality 5/5 4.Battery 5/5 5.Performance 5/5 I am already using iPhone 12. I brought Xr for my brother,i haven't seen any difference between both Display(only dark content are much sharper in iPhone 12, and also camera quality will be better in 12 that's it, performance seem to be almost close enough to Iphone 12) Go for Xr Guys it's worth buying."
59,4,Wonderful,Amazing iPhone. Though iphone 11 is the best till now but still this phone can also go for next 3-4 years atleast if you don't need best camera which iphone 11 or 12 has. Got it around 28k in big billion days with exchange offer and bank offer. Worth every penny that too so less as compared to it's actual price. Switched from Iphone 7 which was also nice handy but had battery and heating issues. Except camera which is not that bad everything else is nice!
60,5,Terrific purchase,It’s my first iPhone and trust me android has nothing like this hardware and software best of best
61,5,Wonderful,"The BEAST OF ALL🔥🔥 I'm writing this review after using it for more than a week. This is my first ever iphone and trust me guys I was confused between this and newer model like SE2 OR 11 OR 12 but this beast is nothing less than the newer ones. I was luck enough to get the charger and earpods with it. It's so smooth, battery life is also good. Camera is beyond expectations!! Go for it it'll never let you down. Getting all the iOS update like the other new models. Just a advice to buy a fast charger adapter it'll be beneficial as it cahrges in half of time than the one's in the box as it's 5 watts charger. I bought boat 18 W fast charger and it charges like a beast. XR IS STILL YHE BEAST!! GO FOR IT. NO lagging and no issues with it."
62,5,Just wow!,"My second iphone after 6S. It's really a beast. After two years from date of launching still it's ahead of most of the android phones. If anyone is confusd between OnePlus and iphone than go for iphone. I have used 6S for four years, did not found any lag even with very heavy usage and after that I sold it at a decent price. Resale value is always great in iPhone.  With great price we get a very decent product."
63,4,Good quality product,"Glad I had bought this phone at 45k before the process went up. Performance is top notch, the A12 BIONIC chipset is a beast. Camera is great and HDR kicks in automatically to bring that extra detail in the photos and videos. Highly recommended."
64,5,Best in the market!,"Coming from a Pixel 3a, was planning to buy SE but they blew up with the Battery. Now coming to XR PROS - Great Single lens Camera Powerful Speakers Generous Battery Life(even the phone is bit old) A12 Bionic chip still kicks some solid competition effortlessly iOS interface will not make you think of number of rams or screen refresh rate at all so smooth Great Haptics Premium Build - Pretty much expected from Apple   CONS - Keyboard is a little messy sometimes will take some time to get used to it No night mode  Thanks Flipkart and Apple For such a beautiful and genuine product 👍🏻"
65,4,Value-for-money,"Now used for almost a week. Performance is great with A12 bionic chip. Almost no lag. Battery lasts for a day with normal usage of online streaming, social media, gaming. Camera is good with great colour accuracy but low light performance is not as expected considering the premium pricing. Overall decent using experience. Blue colour looks cool without case, though one should use case to avoid scratches and glass breaks from unwanted falls. Though 3 gb ram but ram management is excellent. Happy with the product."
66,5,Highly recommended,"I’ve bought this phone in 2021. The phone has an amazing battery life and camera. The screen has a resolution of 720p only but it doesn’t look bad at all in real life. I would give the phone a 10/10 in all departments. The only real let down is that there’s no Fast charging brick in the box or infact no charging brick at all. I ordered this phone twice, first from supercomnet seller and then from truecomretail. The order from supercomnet never came through. I waited for more than 3 weeks for the order, then Flipkart called me and told me that the seller doesn’t have it in stock. The second order from truecom retail got delivered in 5 days. Although the order was shipped from Delhi itself and was to be delivered in Gurgaon. I guess that was due to the pandemic, so no worries. Overall the phone is amazing even in 2021, will last for 3-4 years easily with a single battery change at the 2.5-3 year mark."
67,5,Perfect product!,"iPhone XR is a great mobile with liquid smooth performance from A12 Bionic chip. Battery backup is really good in this mobile compared to other iPhones. I am really doubtful about the display after reading many reviews but trust me this display is one of the best LCD displays I have even seen. But to full charge the mobile it takes minimum of 2 and half hours with in box charger and the build is solid and it looks premium. Just go for it guys, You will love it, it’s worth every penny u spent on this mobile."
68,5,Simply awesome,"I am writing this review after almost 9 month, reason being, i didnt want to rush it by giving half baked reviews. This phone is undoubtedly the best phone among all the phones i have ever used, this phone is all about the useful things at their best and no gimmicks or unnecessary things. Design and look depends on individual, so leaving this on you. Jumping to pros and cons Pros : 1.best feature i like about this is the battery drains only when you use it, and thus it lasts longer and spends the whole day on a single charge. 2. Sound quality from speaker as well as from earpiece is loud, crisp and clear. 3. Haptic feedback in this phone is a true delight, while typing or while scrolling options in a menu. (That ""tic tic"" sound 😁) 4. Night mode in this phone makes it more comfortable during night and dim lighting. 5. Switching between apps and simultaneously using multiple apps is effortless. 6. Back Camera is good, video quality is amazing. 7. Pubg in this phone is one different experience, use it in high frame rate and u will feel the difference, the smoothness is great.  Cons : 1. Drains battery really fast when playing heavy games. 2. Fast charger not included in the box. 3. Its not an easy task to use any custom ringtone,you have to go through a pre defined procedure using ""garageband"" to set custom tunes. 4. While connecting to wifi hotspot you have to keep that ""personal hotspot"" page open. 5. Front camera is not so great, okay for video calls.  These are some points which in my opinion falls under pros and cons and may help you in deciding best for yourself. 😊"
69,5,Highly recommended,Camera is too good.battery backup is also good.i was android user.but now feeling happy using iPhone.ios is too good than android. No bloat ware in iOS. Compact size.easy to use single hand.dont buy one plus 7t and Samsung s10 lite.
70,5,Best in the market!,"It’s just amazing phone, camera is up to the mark not a extremely good you will get natural photos. Battery life is good, touch pad is so good you will just love it. Overall response is good those who are thinking to buy a phone on an around 45k, it will be a great choice."
71,4,Nice product,The product is good but seller isn’t good because i had ordered the phone during offer period and after the offer ended seller was telling me to cancel the order from my side and reorder it again I don’t know why which by then price was hiked back to its normal rate. I had to literally wait for one complete month for the product to be delivered that too by contacting customer care like around 7-8 times and requesting them like anything.
72,5,Worth every penny,Awesome phone. I switched from android to iPhone and I must say it is a great experience and feels so good to be an iPhone person 😎😊
73,5,Excellent,"This is my 3rd iPhone. I am really happy that I chose iPhone XR over iPhone 11/12. Let me tell you, I got to see all the pros in this Phone and I don’t think you’ll see any cons. The best camera The best battery The best performance The best affordable iPhone model The best look  Damn🔥 So grab it guys!  Flipkart...I must say...you guys are the best. One of the most genuine online shopping site! I love your quick and proper delivery. Thank you for your quality products."
74,5,Awesome,very nice phone my first I phone experience good looking and sturdy I like it
75,4,Delightful,Loved the iphone very smooth and boost function and yeah most important stylish and royal when u hold it in ur hands ....Thx
76,5,Just wow!,"This phone is truely a beast ! From camera to display & performance ! If you’re doubting about the display then I’ll say it’s fine !! It’s just fine unless you put a VR Headset on it ! The brightness , colour accuracy , touch response everything is top notch ! Don’t go by on paper specs ! This display has 322 ppi pixel density… if you don’t know then Samsung’s latest phone Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 has a 366ppi pixel density ! Now decide yourself ! And if you’re thinking about updates then you’re getting 3 years of software update and 1 year security patch update by the time I’m writing this review ! The battery backup is very good if you’re a regular user ! If you’re a gamer then you’ll get almost 4 hours of gaming with a single charge and brightness at 50% … performance is beastly despite being a 2.5 year old phone .. camera is absolute beast just lacking night mode if you’re a night shooter then go for iphone 11"
77,5,Brilliant,Best iphone at affordable price . Battery is good but charger is only of 5watt so it takes time to charge. Everything is good yet.
78,4,Nice product,"Good phone not bad, felt happy on purchasing with Flipkart, but to get this product for me it takes 10 days to get from the Ekart logistics, please be quick with process intimate customer in a proper way of shipping goods..  Camera _ 4 Performance_4 Battery_4 Display_3 Overall - 4/5"
79,5,Must buy!,"Upgraded to the new iPhone XR from Apple iPhone 6S .I bought the Product red , as usual Iphone is robust , Colour is good , Display is awesome and battery is running more than 30 hrs with normal use...over all too good , got delivery in 3 days with flipkart"
80,5,Fabulous!,"I was initially skeptical about buying an XR or SE2. Finally, bought XR for its battery capacity and a larger screen. The screen was not really an issue as I used 5s for 4 years. After using it for a week, here are my observations: 1. It's a great phone for everyday usage with a decent camera. 2. Battery lasts really long even if you use it for a longer duration including Netflix, prime, youtube. 3. Camera is good too. You can take good pics and selfies with a portrait mode. Also, can use the camera extensively as the battery lasts long. The iPhone 11 has a better camera, but XR was in my budget. 4. Performance is great with all my office email and chat apps working fine with additional apps. 5. FaceId works really well. 6. Handling and dimensions are up to the current trend. 7. Screen is not bad for an LCD phone.  So, it's the best phone in 40-45k range. I gave a miss to 11 due to budget and also it is not compatible with 5G."
81,5,Classy product,It's a Good smartphone. Im totally satisfied. Love you Apple. Always reliable and safe but little bit problem for Android user like me. This is my first iOS experience after 12 years of using Android. Go for it you'll never regret.
82,5,Excellent,Awesome 👍 nice good job flipkart & saler !!! I LOTS OF LOVE YOU 💟💟💟💟💟 💗💗💗💗💗 perfact iphone not a any issue in this model of iphone XR.many many thanks my lovely app is flipkart. Only 39000/- with full kit also black colour is beautiful...I am impressed for saler & Flipkart.JAYHIND JAYBHARAT from:surat (VIPUL KUMAR PAREKH)nice apple brand.I love you Flipkart.Go for it blind.
83,5,Awesome,The Mobile is Surely worth the money with superb cool camera and with an Awesome display!!!! Its just that i came from an Android device and the Battery are huge in that so facing a bit low battery.... Other than that All thumbs up. And even battery is not an issue as it comes for some 7 to 8 hours backup once charged...
84,5,Terrific,Nice performance. Face id is really quick and battery is ok. Ear phones are good. Overall a great buy even in 2020. I can say a best budget iphone
85,5,Fabulous!,"Close your eyes and go for it. The best one for this price point. Everyone was speculating about the screen let me tell you won’t notice a thing the screen is gorgeous and bright. This thing is a beast in terms of processing power and battery, you can easily end a day with single charge and still get a 40% at the end of the day. In my opinion this phone will last you for atleast 4 years considering the power it house. Go for it."
86,4,Really Nice,"Product is good. Battery backup meets expectation. it has a single camera but, this sensor gives good performance. phone is handy and good looking. So it is almost worth to the money spent."
87,5,Excellent,If you are new to IOS ecosystem then this is your choice... You get latest chipset with sleek design and easy to carry as it is not bulky or heavy... Excellent performance and smooth experience Overall value for money..better than iphone SE 2020 in terms of Battery backup and using experience.. Great for daily use and if you are a heavy user or gamer then go for the 128 gb variant..64gb is enough for moderate users ...
88,5,Value for Money,"I have been using iPhones since iPhone 4 and I bought this one for my daughter as a gift. Great OS, awesome camera, good battery and amazing built. I was doubtful about the HD LCD Screen but surprisingly the quality is very good and there is no visible pixelation."
89,5,Classy product,Yaar I am speechless. It’s a stunning phone and will be a stunning phone for the price tag. It’s a HD pannel but trust me you can’t be able to tell weather it’s HD or Full HD pannel. Baaki toh yaar bas itna hee bol skta sirf use krne ke baad hee samjh me aayega kya cheez hai ye.👌
90,4,Worth the money,When we are getting many features at lowest price ... I don’t feel it’s worth spending more than 55k .... as usual apple products are best in performance and all other aspects except price .... go for it if you can’t use any other mobile other than iPhone
91,4,Really Nice,"Bought this 3 days back and using it heavily.  Charging : Takes 1.30 Hr for a full charging, though apple did little Kanjoosi here, they should have provided the fast charger but anyways its also fine. No issues at all. Battery: one day usage It’s good I played Pubg for 4 hours straight , surf social sites for 2 hours, you tube 1 hour and other stuff like book reading, wynk and all.. so at the end I was left with 9% battery. So ya its good. Camera : similar to XS but slo mo is bit shaky. Rest pictures are good. OS : 12.3.1 I recently got this update and didn’t find any issues with anything yet. Custom center - when you switch off wifi or Bluetooth it automatically gets on @5 its an OS feature don’t mistake it as a device issue. Settings: As usual easy to use. Gesture control is good too.. Though I have worked on many mobiles but this one is a beast not because I have this gadget but if you are willing to spend on Samsung note series better to spend here, you would become life time apple fan..  Samsung note series/ Galaxy / One plus 7 pro was in my list but I’m glad that I chose something diff this time, have been a crazy android lover but now I’m a big ios fan too..  I have coral color and it’s nice (: other color variants looks good too (:"
92,5,Mind-blowing purchase,Still value for money in 2021 The only thing is the slow 5w charger ...so u have to spend more to get fast charger .... otherwise overall its good ... I'm satisfied with flipkarts fast delivery i received it on next day
93,4,Wonderful,"Camera is best part of this phone like any other apple phone. Battery is fine. If camera is not an important factor for you consider buying other android phone at this range as they have better battery, storage and other features. Display and performance is top notch. I just heats sometimes been using it for 3 days. Happy with the purchase just a little overpriced i think."
94,5,Terrific,I must say its a very good phone! I was confused in picking up the colours and finally bought this coral variant. Its so beautiful i love the blue one too! It has amazing camera but takes 2 hrs to charge drom 0 to 100% overall it is pretty good. Recommend you guys to get it during an offer!
95,4,Value-for-money,"Nothing much to write about this product, great phone. Very quick to use. Some key points  1 - Moving photos from android is a pain, Apple wants to ultimately ensure that you're locked into it's ecosystem.  2 - Battery life is ok, with a reasonable amount of use, it can last for a day.  3 - Camera is great in light, but night photography is where this phone lags ( Guess Apple has nailed night photography finally with iPhone 12 ).  4 - I expect the phone to last about 4 years for me. This phone was launched in 2018, so it should receive updates for the next 3--4 years.  5- Apple phones have a great resale value even if I want to switch later on.  6 - buying an iCloud subscription is a great feature for sharing photos. Default storage of 5 gb doesn't cut it. 50 gigs for Rs. 75 and 200 gigs ( shareable with family) for Rs. 220 might seem pricey, but the peace of mind is worth it.  7 - In the long run, you'll see small nudges from Apple to pay for apps or if you're health conscious, buy an Apple watch. Apple watch integration with health apps is far more superior to that of Fitbit."
96,5,Excellent,You’re a PUBG player you love this phone Camera is excellent portrait mood good Portrait only person not object Good battery life performance is excellent Display not a oled but this phones led display is good Value for money 💯
97,5,Fabulous!,Awesome phone from apple  Best camera quality Best screen resolution (forget about the pixels) Great sound output Face recognition will be an awestruck feature in this phone Above all apple user interface is at its best in XR  Thank you flipkart & apple for delivering this product
98,5,Wonderful,"If you're considering iPhone XR in 2021, I think it is still a good choice and definitely a better buy than the SE which looks a decade old. Let's break down its various aspects-  DISPLAY: Your screen is something that you constantly look at. I won't say it is the best screen out there in this price range because it's an LCD panel instead of an OLED with a pretty low resolution. But are you going to notice it in daily use? No, unless you're pixel peeping or use to high quality QHD+ OLED panels.  DESIGN: Not that it matters to me, but to some people it does so, I would say since all the iPhones (even the latest ones) still use the same design with some minor changes it certainly does not feel outdated. A glass sandwich design with aluminium frame. (feels premium in hand as every Apple device out there)  PERFORMANCE: Although, the phone launched in 2018, it doesn't feel slow by any means. A12 Bionic is still capable of competing with the recent high end phones and certainly outperforms any upper midrange device. So, no issues there. Moreover, everything in iPhone is well optimised.  CAMERA: Well, it was a flagship when it was launched so camera is great. It only has One primary lens compared to other phones in 2021 which offers 3-4 lens as well as bigger sensors and higher MP count. So, it does not have the versatility but the single camera output is still better than any midrange device. Just one thing, if you prefer your photos to be vibrant, overly saturated and some beautification like Oppo and Vivo does, this is not for you. iPhone colour science is more inclined towards a natural looking output which some people absolutely love and some people just don't.  BATTERY: When it was launched, it was the longest lasting iPhone out of the bunch. And I feel it is still going to be the same since it offers LCD panel which consumes less power and A12 is quite battery efficient. So battery life should not be a problem.  OS AND UPDATES: There is no need to explain how smoothly iOS runs. Coming to the updates, you must be wondering how long is it going to get updates? Is it good to buy after 3 years of its launch? Well, you get major updates for 5 years and 6 years of Security updates whereas Androids OEMs usually give 2-3 years of Updates. Do the maths, it is probably going to last you more than an android midrange that's for sure.  OTHER PERKS: Wireless Charging IP Rating"
99,5,Must buy!,"This is my 1st I phone, after switching from android phone to iphone I am feeling like ” yeah I made a good choice”. Updated the phone to latest iOS 14.4 now I am really feeling not to switch to android i am not a gamer so my purpose is to call, browse and normal usage, overall i am getting a full day battery, iOS buttery smooth ui interface i would say it is pleasure to watch the animation when you open the phone or app no hanging issue faced till now major concern is moving music files to phone you have to use a PC with iTune app but it is okay for me."
100,5,Simply awesome,"Value for money! Superb performance & camera clarity I have used i5,i6,i7 and now I have switched to XR and I shud say best ever purchase among all the ones despite all of them were good ! Red is super cool colour"
101,4,Nice product,"Good iphone in budget to purchase. Feel is totally different from android. U won't get back to android phones after using iPhone. Camera quality is good with good battery back up. Overall a great buy in flipkart BBS at Rs 37,999."
102,5,Classy product,First of all thanks to flipkart for giving a very good product 8 years use of android now I m shifted from Android to iOS Regarding product Iphone XR is best and value for money Compared to android Use of IOS is awesome but first 2-3 days you will face some difficulty how to download apps How to use all apps once you aware about iOS you will never think of android Friends phone is very fast Battery and Display also very good why i didn't know some people are telling display is not good. Don't compare camera fixle of iPhone and other phone Friends i phone camera is super  Disadvantages Fast charger not provided But overall i phone XR is best go for it
103,5,Classy product,"Frankly this is my 1st review, and Generally In every 6months to 1yr I will change my phone.. Almost I used all brands(including Apple phone before to This XR) I never feel the smoothness performance and battery life in any other mobile like this in the iPhone XR.. This is the performance beast..I don’t use camera much so I’m neutral about it.But camera Quality is Super.. I Really Love this phone.. I’m sure I’m not gonna change this mobile for min 2yrs. I’m enjoying allot. Thanks to the Flipkart I received delivery in less than 2days."
104,4,Delightful,"The phone was a gift for my father. Apart from being on the heavier side, I didn't find an issue with the phone. The hardware, fit and finish and display are spectacular in every way. My Dad being a music lover claims that this is the best sound quality he had ever experienced on any other mobile device! Price could have better though. I still feel the product is overpriced even though I purchased for 54k after heavy discounts. But as long as my father is happy, all is forgiven! :)"
105,5,Wonderful,"This is my first apple product and it’s truly worth the price. Sooner than expected delivery by flipkart, the phone was received in brand new condition and I checked the warranty and authenticity on apple’s site and it’s genuine. iOS is so smooth and amazing, Face ID works like a charm and given the updates till 2023 this phone is the best in 2020. This won’t disappoint you at all. I had heard a lot of criticism about the display but it’s just amazing, a normal consumer won’t bother about lcd and oleds.Thankful to flipkart and Supercomnet for this amazing iPhone ,Apple is always miles ahead of it’s competitions, so go for it."
106,5,Great product,After discount at 54000 this mobile is best due to top class built and best ever OS. Very good camera .
107,5,Just wow!,"The iPhone XR is best Phone forever. Because the best battery life, Best Camera, Best Ultra Liquidretina Display. Mostly the phone Like premium look & Quality. I Recommend 8.5 out of 10. Good Products at 2021."
108,5,Wonderful,"After 10 years of android use, decided to try ios. After a lot of research, I bought this beast. First of all, the os experience is very smooth. Very impressed by the performance. I do not take lot of photos and casually took some photos and it is top notch. Cons: 1. display is just okay. 2. Coming from android, u need to get used to some of the features missing in the ios like call recording (only paid apps in apple store)."
109,5,Just wow!,I jumped from Android to iOS with much excitement n this iPhone XR didn’t disappoint me. Its such a smooth os experience n performance. Great display good battery life awesome touch n feel ok camera. Its a good buy for iphone lovers!
110,5,Must buy!,"I upgraded from Iphone SE, and let me tell you it is by far the best iPhone you’ll ever have. Value for money, Good camera, Amazing battery life which lasts about 8 hours if you use it excessively. If you don’t, you won’t even have to charge for the whole day. Buying this phone was the best decision I’ve ever made."
111,5,Simply awesome,Excellent very nice phone. Super natural camera quality. But dual sim slot should be in india i phone bcoz esim not supported by telecom companies.
112,4,Very Good,Everything is great about the phone except the display. Feels premium.Camera is good but portrait mode works for Human pic only. Display is like 10k android phone.
113,4,Very Good,I wanted very secure phome in this time when cyber crime is going to upscale. There is no phone in market above 30000 which provide chip level security. ios is more secured than android no doubt. So it was a wise decision from my side to choose iphone xr with decent battery life and every year update i am sure upto 2025. So anybody who think of having a fast phone with security can go with iphone xr
114,5,Perfect product!,One the best iPhone out market. Trust me the display is one of the best with most accurate colour reproduction. In terms of speed its like a monster with excellent battery life which can last upto a day and a half for a moderate to heavy use.
115,5,Perfect product!,"I first took the feedback from my friends and all said it has good battery quality so why waste money in 11,11 pro or 12 when XR gives you good value for money. 🙂I never bought mobiles online , this is my first purchase and it was excellent 💯👍. Also I suggest to take a video and check the parcel when the delivery man delivers the item in door step. 1.Good camera 2.Long battery life 3.It comes with cable, Adapter and Earpods 4.Touch and accesibility excellent. 5.I loved the size as it comes handy. I would say Good for it."
116,5,Worth every penny,"Writing this review after good use of 100 days. Its a classic phone value for MONEY. Much better that other Chinese gizmos as one + and vivos and other cheap phones.  Believe Apple had its own charm till date.  As the tag line of Apple says  ""IF YOU DON'T HAVE AN I PHONE, YOU DONT HAVE AN I PHONE"""
117,5,Excellent,"I loved it.. Camera is a superlike, Performance is awesome, and most important battery backup is great. I love this more than 11"
118,5,Terrific,"One of the best decisions I have ever made. When I switched from android to iOS, I thought it’s going to be difficult but it wasn’t. This phone is amazing. It’s fast, have a great battery life, awesome camera (inspite of no night mode, which I don’t need) and flawless performance. Perfect!"
119,5,Terrific,I buy this phone for my father as he always love to use Apple products (I don't know why but he love to use). So I ordered this one for him. The overall work performance is very good. The picture quality is mind blowing. After using around 7-8 months. He is still happy with this phone.. So this a great phone to go for..
120,4,Value-for-money,"I hope no doubt in Apple product. it's very great and super. If I talking about Feature so everything is perfect most important thy is your data security. So Apple always fallow up to secure your data, if you compare Android device. If you want security so no doubt apple is best ."
121,4,Nice product,"Almost used iPhone XR for more than a month now. And overall it’s a great package from apple. Value for money product. Great performance, Great Camera & Display."
122,5,Must buy!,super awesome at first i was a bit tensed that is this a genuine one as i have never shopped for such heavy price from flipkart but i was nore than happy n satisfied but i guess the delivery took a little longer time
123,5,Excellent,"For someone who had been stuck with Android all his life, this was first IOS change. The phone bought during big billion days costed around 40k which again was a pretty well bargain for 128 gb version. Pretty convenient in use and camera quality is simply amaze. The battery issue in X are like non existent here (I guess also depends on usage). For me who uses it for like max 3-4 hours a day, it lasts almost 1-1.25 days in single charge (maybe I don't use pretty heavy usage apps apart from social media ones)  All in all, best deal."
124,5,Worth every penny,"My first iphone😍. I loved it. Very nice product. Red colour is awesome. Great battery backup, it can compete with latest iphones in 2021. Display not bad because of LCD. Apple nailed it with LCD display. Worth for money.  Delivered on next day. Thanks to flipkart."
125,5,Must buy!,"iPhone is iPhone….no one can beat it. I love apple products always …been using iPhone 6s from last 5 years.now I purchased this one for my brother.

Looks like apple started looting people money in the name of green environment … if that is the case why apple selling their accessories separately …?? Definitely they should not make or sell accessories…this is the best way protect our environment.

141,5,Excellent Product,"I have used this phone for like 1 week and then giving this review . I bought it for 43 k (128 GB) model white. Pros- 1-Flipkart delivered it in the estimated amount of time for me it was 2 days and it was delivered to me the same . 2- Camera Quality is awesome u can click large amount of photos live or not live according to you choice . Also you can record slow-mo , time lapse etc at 240 Fps which makes it worth buying . 3- You can also record 4k video with this phone at 60fps . 4- Touch response and face ID recognition is at its best in this phone  Cons-- 1- Battery drains a little but if you dont perform any heavy tasks it will work roughly for 2-3 days ."

147,5,Simply awesome,"Battery management of IPhone XR is pretty good having 6hr screen time. I guess 3GB Ram is sufficient for this phone as I don’t see any lagging. But again it depends how you use the phone.  Camera is quite impressive. And if you have doubt against look wise and then ya that BIG NOTCH will make you irritate.  It supports wireless charging too. It’s heavy comparable to Redmi or one plus , Due to build design."
148,4,Nice product,Some time there is a network problem. Price is very high as Compared to other phone which is available in market. If ur iPhone lover the u can go for it. It is better then iPhone XS.
149,5,Highly recommended,Awesome phone as apple always rocks and Flipkart super fast delivery made my day. phone is superb no lags and battery backup is also superb. I suggest to buy although price is slightly higher but it is ok when u strat using this phone.
150,5,Super!,"1) This is my first iPhone. The phone comes installed with iOS 13.7 and an update of iOS 14 ready to be downloaded. I struggled to download the update, as it requires a high speed wifi and won't download on mobile data. As the download size is 3.4 GB, the download sometimes stops for no reason and it happens to many iPhones world wide. 2) Display is satisfactory. I have been using only android phones till now, and the last phone had a Full-HD screen. However, there isn't any noticeable difference between both the displays. 3) Camera is convincing if you have normal usage and not a photography enthusiast. 4) Battery - So far so good. Only strange thing is that, the battery percentage increases once you restart your phone. For normal usage, it will easily last more than a day. For gamers, less than a day. Charging slows down after it reaches 85%. 5) No heating issues as such. But yes, the back panel gets slightly warm, when used for more than an hour. Having thick back covers may not be a good idea. 6) Call quality is great. RAM management is also convincing. 7) I received the phone on 27/4/2021. The phone was manufactured in September 2020. Overall a good product, so far."
151,4,Wonderful,"I am an andriod user & This is my first ios device.Bought Red Color 64GB variant..Color looks rich and premium in hands I have seen both red and white.. But red looks good and shiny than white. Loved it. Pros: Performance is good Screen is neither small nor big..its perfect size. I have small hands. I am comfortable using with this Camera is good, it has many hidden features No fingerprint but face id is fast even at night Cons: camera in indoors and low light is poor..and no night mode Loading apps is slow and not upto mark, Apps keeps closing with some error"
152,5,Excellent,"Super phone. I bought Rs.40,999/- 128 gb Red Colour. Good deal buy back also my old i phone 7 32 gb Rs.8950/- finally I bought Rs.33249/-. I am a regular I phone user. I used I phone 5 64 gb, I phone 7 32 gb and now I bought this."
153,5,ClawCOBRA,"After using for few months, I would just like to say that after using iPhone, u would not like android again. Specially talking of iPhone XR, this is the first iPhone with excellent battery backup, camera, usage and sound."

155,5,Excellent Product and Price,"This is my first iPhone. Before it, I was confused between XR and 11. But I purchased XR and I am very happy to see this that XR is copy paste of 11. I am very happy to get this. I am reviewing this comment after 1 month of using this phone. I bought this on 37K. Very reasonable price."
156,4,Really Nice,"Phone is good for the first time user of iPhone but not for the other iPhone user who thinks its latest version compared to 8plus this will be degraded version of apple , i donno y this one is not even a full hd display? Its lukg lyk below 10k android phones display, no 3d touch is tolerable bcaz i wont use ofter, upgraded were processor which is a sec faster than a previous nd camera even single portrait was fabulous but viewing that image in this display was lukg bit bad if we transfer that to other model lukg great those pics, my conclusion not worth for 70k this is lyk 5c which disappointed me previously."
157,5,Wonderful,"Awesome performance, ultimate battery backup super looks in diff. Colors. New look iphone... only thind is u need to shed another 4500 bucks for fast charger.."
158,4,Worth the money,The product is amazingly good. I loved it based on my day 1 usage. Camera is definitely the best part of this phone. People who don't want to change thier phone for 2 to 3 years should buy it considering you will get security updates at least till 2023 and the processor is capable enough to work for next 2-3 years easily
159,5,Worth every penny,"Amazing phone with a very powerful battery. Its the most practical iPhone. Though it has a LCD display it still feels premium n feels the best. It's the best choice if being upgraded from iPhone 7 or 8 or any lower iPhone models. Nothing to think of it its the best in the range, the camera, the built, the battery are really powerful.. A worthy purchase"
160,3,Just okay,Came from One plus family and I didnt like ios at all.. Not for people who want to get work done fast
161,5,Just wow!,Best camera. Very fast delivery by flipkart.Some usefull apps are not availabe on ios app store. Battery is good. U can watch VR videos on this phone. I am a primary teacher in uttar pradesh and i am unable to download my usefull app for my job purpose like prerna diksha & read along app which are easily available on android platform. For those app i have to purchase a new android phone. You cant download music on this phone. You have to purchase music app subscription for music. You have to I like to listen songs on this phone very much. If you are thinking to buy this phone then you can go for it without any doubt.
162,5,Classy product,"Can't tell u how good this phone is. however if you don't like iOS it's better to go for the other options like the S10 and OnePlus 7 Pro. but if you need to buy an iPhone in India, there is no better value for money phone than the xr."
163,4,Wonderful,"Switched for the first time to iOS ..it's a different experience altogether as it takes some time to get use to it. Initially it was tough buy after using it for 1month it was Ok. Products hardware and software is good with no lags. Touch is super smooth. Some features are missing if compared to Android which I was using since last 10 years Overall it's a good experience and I beleive that after using for few more days, it will become more friendly."
164,5,Terrific,"I was a bit skeptical about purchasing a phone online however had a great experience, I bought iPhone XR as a gift for my sister and she really loved it so thank you Flipkart for arranging everything so well, from the shipping to the delivery. And not to forget the delivery boy, he was a great guy, I haven’t received any link to provide feedback for him who’s from EKart I guess however would like to extend gratitude towards his service too. Overall a great experience so far🙏🏻🙏🏻 Hope the phone lasts long😊😊!!"
165,5,Fabulous!,Best in class. Battery backup is good just got a week before but the review from my end that it’s going to be great. Camera is fantastic as usual . Performance wise iPhone never lags efficiency. A 4.5 star from me
166,4,Worth the money,"There's no comment on this phone's performance, look, and value for money.  The best thing about purchasing this phone from Flipkart is that they would call you to check if you get the right product or have any issues. This was the first time I got this kind of call from Flipkart. It's really good customer service and it will build great customer base for sure. Thank you, Flipkart."
167,5,Perfect product!,"Here is my short and simple review after switching from Motorola G5s plus to iphone XR  Pros 1. Lag free fluent software. 2. Amazing Camera. (better than my Cannon 1500D DSLR. 3. Security from apps stealing personal info. 4. Screen is LCD but looks like Amoled. 5. Midway price between Iphone SE 2020 & Iphone 11. 6. Guaranteed s/w updates for next 3-4 years. 7. Charger and earphones (Earpods) are included.  Cons. 1. Battery drain. 2. Using Face id in corona time is difficult. 3. If you are gamer then dont buy iphone instead go for mi 10 ultra or Oneplus 8t or Rog phone 2. 4. Apple s/w and h/w ecosystem is expensive. 5. Though waterproof , water damage is not covered under warranty. 6. When you are coming from android then you find difficulties operating iphone such as file transfer or you can not simply copy paste any song / file from pendrive or laptop. 7. Whatsapp backup from android to iphone is not easy and you will have to buy separate third party softwares. 8. Each and every app installation or settings change require apple id password, so use face id."
168,5,Highly recommended,Awesome product my first purchase of iphone is iphone cr   I am so happy with the performance of the mobile phone   A issue that i think is network problems and battery backup is very good but not excellent  But this is my first iPhone purchase i am so happy with my mobile
169,3,Fair,After 15 days of usage rear camera is good front camera is ok. U wont notice HD display until u consume some media display is noticeably less sharp in youtube videos battery life is good
170,5,Brilliant,Fantastic beast it is. Looks stunning just upgraded from iPhone 7. In between I used pixel 3 but I am not satisfied so I returned back to I phone family.
171,5,Brilliant,I am using iPhoneXR since a year now and i would like to mention few good things as below 1. Best battery life 2. Fast response 3. Fairly good storage 4. Big and clear display 5. Nice voice quality I also would like to thank Flipkart for offering genuine product.
172,5,Terrific purchase,"Beautiful piece simply perfect in all dimensions and every aspects just go for it. Camera is mind blowing, perfomance is just like butter on hot pan. Apple ios is fabulous. So amazing user experience. Must purchase this device it can easily exceed your expectation level with what will this phone comes packed with."
173,5,Great product,Very awesome world best company apple i love iphon xr i am very happy
174,4,Worth the money,First time Iphone user. Awesome phone. Got it for a reasonable price with earpod and adapter. Good battery backup and no lagging.Product delivered was one year old. Manufacturing date was August 2020
175,4,Wonderful,Pros * Good and value for money * Very nice camera * Ios is love so no issue on processor and software * Display size perfect * Battery enough if used wisely * Sound output is superb Cons * Display is good but not good as compared to other iphones. If compared side by side then only you will find the difference otherwise its good. * Low light photo not that good  You can go for it best phone in 38k
176,5,Good Buy,"As expected both phone and delivery are excellent and as per scheduled time. Phone is beautiful crimson red with obvious smooth feather touch and clear display. I got great deal too at 37,999/-.  Only downside is apple is not providing charging adapter and earpods with it(citing environmental reason). I have already ordered it. I will be able to explore further Detailed features only after i receive the charger (i choose apple original)."
177,4,Very Good,Very good display. In fact best LCD display. Amoled displays cause eye strain but LCD display does not. So people having sensitive eyes should go with LCD displays only. Camera is very good too. Moderate usage gives one full day of battery. Performance is good. May be iPhone 12 performs better than this but for day to day usage this is more than enough. Overall the most value for money iPhone.
178,5,Terrific purchase,At first I must say it's not that bright red it's beautiful cherry red. And it's 100% real and I did all the reality check. Battery is not that long lasting but it can give you backup of 18 hours if you use it so much. Display and camera is outstanding. Super handy and gorgeous. I am now a satisfied Iphone xr user 😊
179,5,Fabulous!,One of the best ever iPhone.In the start i thought that i should have bought iphone 11 but now after using the phone for 9 months i feel that buying iPhone XR was the best decision i made.Value for money phone👍 I hav been using iphone for around 5 yrs but this is the best phone till date.Keep it up apple and continue with the good work😊
180,5,Classy product,"First of all, I have to thank Flipkart logistics for the super fast delivery. The specs of the phone is not what I expected, they are superb. Picture clarity and sound quality is almost out of this world. What I had not expected was the seller’s promise of supplying lightning connector and EarPods with connector would be fulfilled. That is what clinched the deal for me. Now the price has increased by 4000/-. So all in all, I am a very happy Flipkart customer."
181,5,Terrific purchase,Valuable for money ...battery is amazing camera is super mobile works faster ♥️
182,5,Excellent,It's a very good phone.the camera is very good.the battery is good but can be bit better. The display is very nice.the performance is very much good as it is A12 which is lightning fast.overall it is a value for money phone You have not to compromise in any thing except battery. if you are a gamer and you have to play for long times then you will have problem in battery.
183,5,Worth every penny,Excellent phone. Battery performance is unlike other iPhone models. Minor itch is in respect of selection of sim in auto SMS requirements like google pay. A safe bet for secured financial transactions
184,5,Highly recommended,"Got it at 36.5K. At this price, you get a flagship phone with guaranteed performance for 5 years and then resale value. Display is not the best Apple has but it still amazing to look at, no complaints at all. Maybe you will run out of storage if you click too many photos and videos, since its camera is exceptionally good.  Best part is the 4K video recording with stabilization. If you know how to shoot, you can take cinematic videos from this phone. You can check my video on youtube, search ""Maheshwar short film iphone"" and you will be amazed at how sharp and stable the camera movements are even when handheld. It has just one wide angle camera which is made of fine optics and the software processing gets the best out of it.  Right now, iPhone 11 is worth the extra 10K but this phone is by no means dated. The performance is just mind blowing fast as expected from iPhone. One can expand memory by using Google Photos/Drive or just using a lightning USB 3.0 pen drive.  Nice to have the basics like lightning cable and power adapter. Also the earpods are great to have. Just makes it worth it with their excellent sound quality."
185,5,Awesome,It’s my second iPhone I just loved it the Face ID is superb and very beautiful and best iPhone
186,5,Super!,Very awesome phone. I love this variant of iPhone. Great performance nice display awesome camera and battery backup is also good. All these things are good but if Apple will give a fast charger with box then it was fully complete package.
187,5,Best in the market!,Too amazing and superb look guys i love it too fast processor it has
188,5,Awesome,"It is a awesome phone. iPhone are well known for secure data & pictures and bank accounts app. Next people who thinks that iPhone are always costly than android. They should also think about versions of network data speed like 2g 3g 4g. In android phone when india adopt 4g network then all 2g and 3g android phones were unable to work with 4g sim with 4g speed whereas old iPhone works smoothly with speed with 4g network sim with speed, so in case no need to change iPhone for next next network. Only update iPhone software with smile and forget all worries about network change. Think iPhone Think Big .. Thank you to understand and read complete review. ( Bank Manager Cooperative bank - tarn taran )"
189,4,Value-for-money,"Nice I phone this is the first time am using an I phone from android everything was amazing I just love the phone camera ,operating, and audio quality everything was superb ..& I was satisfied this product.."
190,5,Wonderful,One of the fantastic phone in range of 40k best camera best display best battery
191,5,Awesome,"This is my first iPhone purchased in last Republic Day sale.As i am writing this review after a month used almost.  Camera- Super clarity and get nice images.Front camera is OK. Battery-Lasting for a day for a medium users and bad thing that they provided 5W charger as it takes more than 2hrs. Performance: IOS is Awesome and no lag while playing Heavy games such as ASPHALT and it’s like fluid experience. Display:Even this is LCD screen,colour accuracy is perfect Sound:Audio sound output is stereo speakers and those are very good.  I think many android users are feeling like IOS is so much restrictive but be frankly i never felt although i was in android platform for many years Finally this worth for money."
192,5,Brilliant,I am writing this review after 1 week of use.. This is best phone you can go for.. moving from android to ios i was in a big doubt that will it be the good decision to buying the apple iphone but after purchase i love it. Battery performance is super more than any mi or samsung etc.
193,5,Wonderful,Very smooth performance. nice camera quality. We can open multiple apps mobile wont get struck.. there is not much difference between phone11 and xr except nightmode wide angel lens. Value for money. Go for it
194,5,Fabulous!,"I have used iPhone 7 128gb variant. That phone was pretty good but the battery performance is not good. I was to supposed to charge the battery twice a day. Now in iPhone xr i have to charge only one time at the morning and seriously it gives me about 14-24hrs of battery backup (depends on the usage). Camera is awesome, battery is awesome, display is good not bad. Overall i will give the xr 4.8/5 rating."
195,5,Fabulous!,"Well, its been 7 long years that I stopped using an Iphone and moved to Android. But boy oh boy I must say I missed my Iphone every single day and then I finally bought the XR Black after a long wait. All I can say is the wait was absolutely worth it and im enjoying my phone every single time I use it and it gives me great joy just looking at it. Once an iphone always an iphone!!!!"
196,4,Worth the money,"I bought this mobile after some research and I am satisfied with this mobile. If you are looking for an iPhone under 45000k, then XR is your mobile. Great battery backup ,dual sim, good camera and best performance.. just go for it."
197,5,Simply awesome,"Undoubtedly great single camera both front & back . Excellent battery. Super fast processor. Smooth experience. Great built quality. Feels premium in hand. At Rs35,000/- (that too with emi during big billion days offers) , perhaps the best smartphone value for money, one can buy in 2020. Thanks to Flipkart."
198,5,Awesome,Phone is super at lowest price best offers best deals Flipkart is best
199,5,Perfect iPhone in 2021,Great product for the prices iPhones are best value when bought after an year or so of its launch. Got it for an amazing price smooth experience so far great cameras great battery life when compared to iPhone X. Display is good too nothing to complaint about Prrformance is at par with every android flagship on sale Go for it if on a good price it will last for at least 2-3 years on ios support.
200,5,Just wow!,This is my first iPhone. Great processing power. You can easily do live stream while playing free fire without experiencing any frame drop. Camera quality is great in daylight condition but not that good in night light condition. It captures natural color. Battery backup is good for a 3000mAH battery.
201,5,Excellent,"Bought XR black 128 gigs. Absolutely Worth and value for money 40-45k budget. Pros easily out weigh cons. Go for it.  Pros: iOS. No nonsense. Security. Perfect size. Not too big nor small. Liquid Retina display Camera is good Build quality, glass back & premium feel Face unlock is super quick A12 Bionic chip. Excellent performance. Lightning connector headset quality Apple woo factor.  Minor Cons: Finger print unlock feature could have helped Phone weight in hand 5w Charger takes 3-4 hours for full charge On full charge, Battery comes for ~6-7 hours call & social media consumption to gather."
202,5,Terrific,"I was so lucky to get this product in 35k. Pros- Long battery life my screen on time is more that 6hr never thought would get this much. No legging issue whatsoever, Despite being a heavy user. Awesome Camera but front camera is not that good compared to other phones. 15k phone front camera can beat it. Cons- Slow charger provided in the box. I find this phone to be on the higher side in terms of weight.  If you are kind of guy for whom front camera is not the key point than you wont find anything good this price range. Trust me from price to performance ratio it is even better that iPhone 11 and IOS 14 security features are just great"
203,5,Fabulous!,"After searching for 5 months i got the best phone in 2020 which is indeed a 2018’s launched phone. The processor, camera and battery is much better than i phone X. And obviously the value of money factor in comparison to i phone 11. Great !!"
204,5,Perfect product!,Fast delivery by flipkart mobile is fantastic for this price range camera is awesome and pubg plays smoothly ....not sure about battery will update about it later....go for it.
205,5,Just wow!,It’s been almost a month now and I love the experience.. Should buy and yes red color looks super sexy 😁
206,5,Classy product,Phone is awesome... takes time to charge almost 3:30hours to get 0 to 100% although supporting fast charge but you have to purchase a genuine 18 w charger for it. Camera is overall good. Premium looking phone
207,5,Terrific,Excellent phone with high speed processor has very decent features and battery life is best among the iPhone models and also suitable for gaming with good graphic. Overall can buy without second thought.
208,5,Terrific,This is my first iphone and i would say its awesome . Camera is very good Battery life is really awsome its stands more than 1 and half day . Phone is really very smoth when you play Pubg while opened multiple apps in background.
209,5,Highly recommended,Best iphone in this budget Gives a feel of premium phone Camera is excellent Battery once charged gives a full day usage to normal user It is worth buying
210,5,Brilliant,iPhone is best phone I love it good performance nice camera
211,5,Fabulous!,It has been wonderful experience using this phone and going back to Apple. This my 8th iPhone and it still amazes me with its ease of use and simplicity.
212,4,Wonderful,"The Iphone XR has a great camera, good processor and a very good body finish. But the battery backup isnt yet that great. If you use your phone for normal usage like instagram music WhatsApp it lasts for 6-7 hours at max. Battery drops by 1% every 2-4 minutes. The battery is a big issue when it comes to regular users. Rest all works awesome."
213,5,Brilliant,"9-Aug-2019: My first brave step to choose iOS and I don't repent my decision. 1. Compared to Android iOS is so smooth. Super fluidic response and also the security is great. 2. Moving from Android, you need a lot of time to get used to iOS as it's not as easy usage as Android. 3. Activated airtel eSIM in just 2 hours which works exactly like physical SIM.  Disadvantage: There is no finger print reader. This could have been given behind where the apple logo is making it almost invisible to know that there's finger print reader."
214,5,Highly recommended,"Awesome Battery back up - full day net on WhatsApp live location on 9am to 10 pm , at 11.30 20% remaining 4k Vedio smoothly playing No heating issue Camera equivalent to DSLR , some pop up camera in the market like 48mp its 12 on xr but 1000% better than that. Red is awesome ( Name Product Red, have a nobel cause also help the cancer patient ) hot spot sharing also great I think its better than oled, amoled, Display its very Smooth to veiw ( just like Plasma TV vs Led TV )"
215,1,Absolute rubbish!,"Not sure why I bought this. Must be an accident. Why? Will,  1. Display is not even Full HD. Retina display is a gimmick. 2. Camera is overrated. Nothing's extraordinary about it. 3. Performance, well, if you're not allowed to customize, not installing apps or games, how will you calculate performance? Remember, Windows 10 S? It's same. 4. OS is nothing special, like the android. Only miss the Lumia phones! 5. Battery is so so. Better not talk about it. Oh yes, this model comes with a charger! 6. Price is almost 2.5 times higher than it should be. 7. Photos are not extraordinary. Nothing to talk about it. Pretty petty. 8. Yes, it overheats.  I regret the purchase."
216,4,Really Nice,"What? Nope, I didn't sell my kidney, because I am rich. But not that rich, else would have bought iPhone 11 Pro Max XS Ultra whatever. So what's good in this phone? People think I am Ok Rich. And it looks like the same iPhone 7 I had earlier. Even same wallpaper. What's Bad? My living room doesn't have the LG 4K 55"" TV I wanted cos I spend the money on this one. Should you buy? Yes, else how will Tim Rob Jobs Cooks or any Apple employee will buy the next Tesla? With your money of course."
217,5,Best in the market!,"there is a confusion choose between android and ios ,Now listen me carefully ios gives you smoothest screen feel and performance is outstanding but it fall down in battery quick ,also takes lot of time to charge unless android have now fast chargers that really does the work fast .i would suggest go for one plus mobile they are now coming in more afforadable prices and phones gives premium feel like iphone."
218,3,Good,If u r going to buy iPhone then go for I phone 11 or upper versions. Performance wise I will say it is not the best phone in the market. The best thing about the iPhone is always it’s hardware. The outer finish is just perfect & it looks really nice.
219,5,Worth every penny,Go for it instead of iPhone 11 you can buy iPhone xr every thing you got the same . Happy with the product but not with ekart because the didn’t exchanged my old phone by making some non sense reasons and also they dot even have a swipe machine in their office the delivery boy said it will be 8-9 pm sir instead you can go office and collect your parcel .. overall phone is pretty good but not happy with ekart services
220,4,Wonderful,"Honest review after extensive use of 1 month. 1. Battery backup is awesome. With internet on whole day and maximal use, battery percentage at end of the day is around 30-40%. This is so far the best battery I have seen in any apple product. 2. Ease of access is also good. Especially the face id makes your locking and unlocking, payment experience smooth and joyful. 3. Sound quality is awesome and with a screen size of 6.1 inch, serves a lot if you're watching a movie. 4. Camera is not up to the mark. Single camera is there, but quality is not very good, at least not at par with other iphones. 5. Only series of apple with dual sim."
221,5,Terrific purchase,"Classy Phone. For people out there still confused about this phone, don’t even have a second thought, just grab right away. Its been a couple of days I got this phone and I’m totally in love with it. Thank you Apple and thank you Flipkart for the quick delivery."
222,5,Awesome,"Battery backup : I have been a android user since 2010 and used many android phones this last decade both high end and low end ones and I never had a mobile last me 2 full days of usage!  Android vs iOS : I want to point out both android and iOS have their merits and demerits but as a consumer we should know exactly what we need in a phone before deciding on the Os .  iOS is comparably slow to android but that's just the extra animations in iOS you could equate iOS to oneui or miui in terms of speed but they both are not as smooth and polished in the execution as iOS .  Camera : In both android and iOS devices it's always the same you get what you paid for , so if you're looking for the best camera in Apple ecosystem this phone not it but remember you will get your money's worth of camera provess so exact good photo and video clarity ."
223,5,Mind-blowing purchase,This Product was such a good Quality. This IPhone XR Deign quality was very nice. & thank to flip kart to give good product and delivery. i am very frequent customer in flip kart. but i bought this product in flip kart i really appreciate the quality of delivery & easy to access online platform to buy such a good product. i suggest all the Apple Mobiles freaking people buy this product.
224,4,Nice product,"Very nice phone with good durable built and colors, screen quality is also very nice. Everything is perfect about this phone except that it is a little heavier as compared to same segment of phones. Also price is on the upper side when compared to similar segment of phones but i guess that's an apple trademark ;)"
225,5,Terrific,"This is my first Apple phone having migrated from Android to iOS. My initial hesitation to be spending twice the amount on this apple phone vis-a-vis any good android phone has been laid to rest after having used this product for last 5 months. Go for this iphone if you have heavy calling requirements, normal camera usage and need to be assured of a lot of privacy from the snooping apps one does download these days. For me, the privacy part is enough reason to be opting for this reliable device."
226,5,Good Phone.,"The item is simply beautiful. More so with its rich, vibrant RED color. Very well designed too. Got a good price along with exchange of my earlier iphone 6. This is the last of the model which came with a charger ( slow one though ) and earphones too. The display is bright and vibrant. Size of the phone is also good. It has weight. Iphone 6 was simply feather light. Everything is slick and fast. Happy with my upgrade and purchase. Easily recommended."
227,5,Just wow!,"Needed to upgrade my phone as I was using a 6s. It’s a bit large and cannot easily use with on hand as I could the older phone. However performance is excellent and extremely smooth. Very responsive to touch and the Face ID is very responsive. Easy to unlock and have had no issues so far. Ear phones are wired and it has no 3.5 mm jack so older ear phones will not work with this. Overall, very satisfied with the purchase."
228,5,Perfect product!,Display is good enough for everyday use.Nothing to complain about.Camera is very good and and phone is smooth in any situation.Battery lasts for about a day which i think could have been better.It is a value for money product.
229,5,Terrific,Moving to IOS from Android is a top notch experience. User interface is amazing. Camera quality in light is amazing. Battery back is superb for normal use it almost comes for 1 and half day. Touch is very responsive. Face ID is flawless even in low light conditions. U can’t expect more and it’s a Must buy product in this range.
230,3,Nice,"I’m using iPhone for several years but couple of things I noticed this time. I switched to this device from iPhone 7 and my feedbacks are -  Cons: - The phone is very heavy and thick even Galaxy A51 is thinner than this - The NAUTCH, oh my god 😳😳 its too big for that apple did lot of adjustments like battery percentage doesn’t show, bluetooth connected device doesn’t show - Camera will serve the purpose  I personally don’t like the big phones for me I guess iphone SE or 12 mini would be good.  Pros: - Performance is too good better than same range latest oneplus - Display is ips but it’s very good near to Samsung Galaxy A51 super amoled - Face unlock its too fast. But now days there is a issue for the mask. And it’s really very frustrating to unlock this huge heavy phone in one hand by entering the 6 digits pin 🤦🏻‍♂️ To solve this problem you have to purchase Apple Watch 😂  Flipkart delivery was good."
231,5,Terrific,"Very nice product in this price range (I've got this for 35999). Made in india, nice call quality nice, video recording, little disappointing about camera but it still better than so many phones at this range. I'm using it for past 3days and getting charging backup for nearly 8hrs, if its ur first iOS you will feel some uncomfortable but sure you enjoy useing it. If you have more budget go for 128gb."
232,5,Just wow!,"Really I couldn’t stop thinking abt phone all the time man it’s beautiful consistent and super fast ,my first experience with iPhone and I’m having fun thanks a lot to Flipkart for delivering product in time and seller had it perfectly packed I’m very happy with the purchase"
233,5,Excellent,"Trust I’m a fan of this device. Probably The best budget product form Apple. Hats off to this device. Top notch performance. Battery is awsome. You may heard that display is not good but trust me you’ll find nothing less in this display. Truly good display quality, and as it’s a lcd display it helps to reduce the battery usage much more than any other amoled display and neither it will hurt ur eyes. Just go for it."
234,5,Simply awesome,"Got it as a gift for my better half on eve of our anniversary. Ideal if one wants to try out iOS after spending long time with Android (for a change in the usage/experience) the phone is available now at a cost effective price, would recommend to go for it!"
235,5,Terrific,"Amazing phone, upgraded from an iPhone 6s and this phone is a beast. White colour looks the best. Playing PubG at extreme frame rate now. Battery life is great can easily last your for two days if you are an average user. With games it lasts for a day."
236,5,Terrific purchase,"Very much satisfied with the flipkart delivery Got it for 36k in big billion day sale Coming to device, 1.The performance is mind numbing 2.Battery is very efficient though (thanks to the 7nm tech a12 bionic) 3.Dont mind the on paper specs of display,the display is crispy enough and supremely colour accurate(dont compare with amoled) and sufficient brightness even in bright sunlight 4.Sound quality is awesome in this device both from earpods and stereo built in speakers 5.Also no need to say particularly about built quality of apple devices,same here with various colour options. 6.Face id works with in no time at all 7.E sim works with out any issues as well.  Things that bothers about this device are the 1.Freaking 5w slow charger in the box even device is capable of fast charging(can upgrade with apple fast charger which works with usb-pd cable which costs more than 5k/-) 2.Not providing the dongle(lightning to 3.5mm cable adapter which costs almost 900/-) in the box. 3.even the display is good enough,in this price range if it comes with more pixel density with fullhd+ resolution it will be brilliant."
237,5,Highly recommended,Totally satisfied with the phone. Worth a buy if you need a smooth battery efficient mobile
238,5,What a wow!!!,"It's the best phone, It's better than iPhoneX as X have A11 bionic chip and XR have A12, XR has same camera as XS and XS Max. Also with better face reorganization, And the best battery of all."
239,5,Just wow!,My first iphone and having a amazing experience Battery back up is too good Camera is awesome Best phone to buy in 2021 I am so happy thank you flipkart🥰
240,3,Nice,"I’m using iPhone for several years but couple of things I noticed this time. I switched to this device from iPhone 7 and my feedbacks are -  Cons: - The phone is very heavy and thick even Galaxy A51 is thinner than this - The NAUTCH, oh my god 😳😳 its too big for that apple did lot of adjustments like battery percentage doesn’t show, bluetooth connected device doesn’t show - Camera will serve the purpose  I personally don’t like the big phones for me I guess iphone SE or 12 mini would be good.  Pros: - Performance is too good better than same range latest oneplus - Display is ips but it’s very good near to Samsung Galaxy A51 super amoled - Face unlock its too fast. But now days there is a issue for the mask. And it’s really very frustrating to unlock this huge heavy phone in one hand by entering the 6 digits pin 🤦🏻‍♂️ To solve this problem you have to purchase Apple Watch 😂  Flipkart delivery was good."
241,5,Terrific,"Very nice product in this price range (I've got this for 35999). Made in india, nice call quality nice, video recording, little disappointing about camera but it still better than so many phones at this range. I'm using it for past 3days and getting charging backup for nearly 8hrs, if its ur first iOS you will feel some uncomfortable but sure you enjoy useing it. If you have more budget go for 128gb."
242,5,Just wow!,"Really I couldn’t stop thinking abt phone all the time man it’s beautiful consistent and super fast ,my first experience with iPhone and I’m having fun thanks a lot to Flipkart for delivering product in time and seller had it perfectly packed I’m very happy with the purchase"
243,5,Excellent,"Trust I’m a fan of this device. Probably The best budget product form Apple. Hats off to this device. Top notch performance. Battery is awsome. You may heard that display is not good but trust me you’ll find nothing less in this display. Truly good display quality, and as it’s a lcd display it helps to reduce the battery usage much more than any other amoled display and neither it will hurt ur eyes. Just go for it."
244,5,Simply awesome,"Got it as a gift for my better half on eve of our anniversary. Ideal if one wants to try out iOS after spending long time with Android (for a change in the usage/experience) the phone is available now at a cost effective price, would recommend to go for it!"
245,5,Terrific,"Amazing phone, upgraded from an iPhone 6s and this phone is a beast. White colour looks the best. Playing PubG at extreme frame rate now. Battery life is great can easily last your for two days if you are an average user. With games it lasts for a day."
246,5,Terrific purchase,"Very much satisfied with the flipkart delivery Got it for 36k in big billion day sale Coming to device, 1.The performance is mind numbing 2.Battery is very efficient though (thanks to the 7nm tech a12 bionic) 3.Dont mind the on paper specs of display,the display is crispy enough and supremely colour accurate(dont compare with amoled) and sufficient brightness even in bright sunlight 4.Sound quality is awesome in this device both from earpods and stereo built in speakers 5.Also no need to say particularly about built quality of apple devices,same here with various colour options. 6.Face id works with in no time at all 7.E sim works with out any issues as well.  Things that bothers about this device are the 1.Freaking 5w slow charger in the box even device is capable of fast charging(can upgrade with apple fast charger which works with usb-pd cable which costs more than 5k/-) 2.Not providing the dongle(lightning to 3.5mm cable adapter which costs almost 900/-) in the box. 3.even the display is good enough,in this price range if it comes with more pixel density with fullhd+ resolution it will be brilliant."
247,5,Highly recommended,Totally satisfied with the phone. Worth a buy if you need a smooth battery efficient mobile
248,5,What a wow!!!,"It's the best phone, It's better than iPhoneX as X have A11 bionic chip and XR have A12, XR has same camera as XS and XS Max. Also with better face reorganization, And the best battery of all."
249,5,Just wow!,My first iphone and having a amazing experience Battery back up is too good Camera is awesome Best phone to buy in 2021 I am so happy thank you flipkart🥰
250,4,Worth the money,Nice mobile apps and performance is very good when compared to other China android mobiles in the market. But overall i still prefer android over iOS as it has more customisation . But if you are looking for mobile with great camera and performance then go for it
251,5,Simply awesome,It's an amazing product with high quality camera visibility.... it has a 6.1 inch display that is equal to iphone 11 pro... so it's worth it . N thank you flipcart for the fastest delivery
252,5,Terrific,I just got my xr from Flipkart the delivery was really quick I got it in within 3 days whereas the expected time was 4-6 days I am iOS friendly user I have using iPhone since iPhone 6 then 7 and now xr The phone is very handy The phone has a best quality camera although it has a same megapixel that of 7 but still it works more beautifully The display is a bit yellowish due to its OLED display over all display experience it Gud The battery is much improved in the xr as I frequently play games still it gives 10-12 hrs backup minimum The touch is very smooth Overall this phone is perfect buy for me at Rs 65000.
253,2,Expected a better product,"Functionality wise android is much superior. You will miss a lot of useful features like app lock, downloading of your favourite videos or songs after switching to iOS. Network issue is also there. My mi phone had better network reception than this phone. Camera and audio quality are superb in iPhone."
254,3,Just okay,Everything good but the main dis advantage is that it will get lot of time to get charged as no fast charging option is available
255,3,Never move from Android to iOS,"If you are using a Android flagship, never buy an iPhone - EVER.  I was using Oneplus 7T before this and bought for the iPhone brand coming back to Apple after 10 long years. I was extremely dissappoined. Cons - Software is 3-4 generations behind Android in terms of user experience. Too many things difficult to do on iPhone, like even a copy paste selection - Touch is very difficult to manage. Most times it wont select right alphabets and sometimes touch itself is not sensitive - Resolution of XR is poor. I feel like going back 7-8 yrs coming from OP7T - Battery charging is pre historic era. Takes hours and hours. Modern Androids take it to full charge in 100min or less now. I mostly plug by iPhone overnight for charging. One nigth if I forget, I will never be able to full charge by phone - It takes way toooo long. Fast charger spec also doesnt feel like it will improve charging speed much.  Pros - Camera is good - Build quality is good - No lags  Buy iPhone only for the brand show off. NOTHING ELSE"
256,5,Fabulous!,"okay so it has been 3 months using i phone XR and you won't believe how amazing it is. I was not convinced by this phone before I really wanted to purchase I phone 11 instead of this, but one of my friends suggested me to purchase this in 128 Gb variant it's totally better than the 11, in terms of battery life it looks good, cute, and catchy at the same time and most important thing you are not getting a power adapter and earbuds in the i phone 11 boxes."
257,5,Excellent,"First time moved to IOS from Android. Excellent performance, great camera, good battery life and excellent gaming performance. Overall fully satisfied with this device. Sound quality is awesome. My rating to this device is 9/10"
258,5,Highly recommended,"Nicely packed delivered by sfxdel boy opened by my daughter and only delivery boy exit from my premises. This is my fourth iPhone. Xr was my dream because of the features, screen size and pricing. Now I updated with ios14 too. Am really happy. This time I choosed White colour, which is really a marvellous piece. Thank you Apple and flipkart."
259,3,Just okay,"I was using one plus 7 before which is way better and cheaper than iPhone XR in every aspect,better display,better performance, better camera and better battery and more storage.i had to buy this phone simply for the Apple Watch otherwise I would have never bought iPhone XR."
260,5,Super!,Wow wonder of I phone y people will like Ds nice build quality is superb sound 😎 camera 👑 nice phone
261,5,Perfect product!,"A good seamless experience for most part, my dominant use is calls and basic usage of net so battery life was a priority, which is good and the phone can last 2 days on a single charge for basic usage. Overall a good package in terms of smoothness of OS, features and performance and not to forget a pretty convenient size for old school folks like me who want their phones to be handled by palms and not arms….."
262,5,Terrific,"Really I decided to purchased XR with the opinion of the peoples review but really i say the seller is very smart to sell best XR I’m really very happy to have an this iphone thankyou Flipkart to drop a best price segment and best phone, a person needs that he get all best service in his budget and company never fraud them love this iphone"
263,4,Wonderful,"Product is an original one, good and excellent but there are no EarPods and Charging Adapter as mentioned in the product description. So do not believe the description. It a pure marketing strategy. Saying one thing and delivering another thing"
264,5,Perfect product!,"Well,to begin with , I made a major switch... From a mid range xiaomi mobile to this... I was confused between one plus 9 r and this one... But believe me...this might be an old apple product but it wouldn't be in the market if it was capable....  Why to consider : * the camera quality in daylight is awesome.. Better than many android falgships.. * if you are bored of using android for a long period of time..go for this * if security is one of your concerns while using an android device..switch to this ..ios has one of the best security standards... * awesome gaming performance ( runs pubg and cod mobile at highest settings without any lags or min frame skips ) .. * the apple logo on the back...no one plus or xiaomi or realme would turn heads like an Iphone does !!!  Why not to consider : * the battery runs a day at fair usage ( browsing through social media and texting ) and 5-6 hours at high usage ( gaming or video streaming ) * screen size is good for people who are not a fan of big displays that require you to use both hand to operate ..but if you are...go for one plus instead * low light photography is average * you might require some time to adjust to the notch present in the display .. That's all I could say after using the product so far.. Trust me..you wouldn't regret buying this one.."
265,5,Terrific,I think this one is the best phone from Apple. Awesome display with a much improved battery performance compared to other variants. Extremely happy with the phone as well as the delivery. Kudos to the seller and Flipkart!!
266,5,Terrific,As a premium phone the quality of the product is nice. Well finished edges. Have a good battery life. For normal use the camera is okay.  Satisfied. Worth for money.
267,4,Delightful,Awesome mobile. Battery backup is amazing comparable to android phones. Display is LCD but far better than android HD + display. Camera is the best thing of the phone.
268,5,Terrific,"Apple XR is worth buying even in 2021. Perfect combination of art and technology. Storage and RAM is better than so called 8GB/256 GB phones. Camera is better than 48/64MP...Its quality which matters, not claimed specs.5 star for phone and quick delivery"
269,5,Just wow!,The product which is I ordered is genuine I am loving this I phone xr and enjoying to use this one thankyou Flipkart your trust is remarkable thanks again....
270,4,Worth the money,Purchased a month ago in just 33000/- PROS: 1. 1.5 days battery backup 2. Best camera for capturing HDR pics 3. Premium body 4. Zero lag in multitasking 5. Best speaker/mic for calling 6. Sound at max with deep clarity for music/videos 7. Both SIM (ESIM & Physical) are working fine together 8. Best performance when gaming 9. Quick charging  CONS: 1. Front screen require a guard all the time 2. It is so smooth and slippery 3. Quite big so have issue with holding in one hand   (I will write a review again after 6months)
271,5,Terrific,I love iPhone it’s best mobile for valuable money.. always prefer apple family for mobiles.
272,5,Classy product,"Upgraded from Iphone 6, and I believe this is a really good deal at this price. Battery is excellent, display is great and the camera is just too good. Gives true natural colours. It would have been good to get the fast charger along with it though. It's also a bit thick."
273,5,Excellent,This is a cool phone. Worth for its price i must say. The user experience is amazing in every aspect i could think of. As Steve Jobs one said design is not not something you feel or see it’s what you work with. i phone never disappointed me except for the price. And this one is worth it compared to other Samsung and google.
274,3,Does the job,Everthing is good but still iphone 7 plus have way more better speakers rather then XR and the camera quality is not very good. Further if you are looking for budge iphone then XR will be the best choice
275,4,Value-for-money,"I loved it. it's beautiful. There's just this heating problem whenever I turn the hotspot on. Also battery isnt that great. You buy you buy a cover aswell, hella slippery. Audio quality is superb. The charging is slow(obviously) but yeah I used the 18w charger for my vivo, there's a significant loss in charging time. Camera is amazing but I wish there was a little more zoom. Face unlock works 98% of the times."
276,5,Just wow!,Very nice phone my first iPhone got it with a good deal on BBD sales very much satisfied with the seller and Flipkart for a genuine product
277,5,Classy product : Excellent phone for Excellent Price,"Awesome.. I liked the blue color, which is better than the image, i usually buy black but happy with blue this time, The Phone is nice and charging is faster."
278,4,Value-for-money,Purchased during big billion day...phone was delivered on time. I'm a first time iPhone user..little time taken to adjust to the changes in UI compared to android. Yet to completely understand the advantages of ios..2 major points...camera image quality is too good and color reproduction is excellent. Battery is good and for normal usage I'm getting for 1.5 days.
279,5,Classy product,"Really it’s an excellent phone after a week i am writing a review about this Good battery back up , Display is really good as I expected .Over all WOW"
280,5,Excellent,"Amazing piece of technology . Amazing camera and good battery life , display is ok and no problems with it ..colour saturation is missing yet beautiful display."
281,5,Must buy! XR is an Beast !!,The product is excellent!! Don't even think of neglecting this beast. I would this is the best phone You will get for 40k. Thanks to flipkart for such a superb deal. I was thinking to go for iphone X but I never regret of making a choice to go with Xr. A12 makes the way for a better world. Just go for it man.
282,5,Classy product,Thanks flipkart for delivering the product a day ahead. I have one issue though there is a black spot on the rear camera and when I am trying to take a picture it still appears on the picture too.  Coming to xr well what should I say... it is a beast. The best battery out there and best performance and frankly what a camera it is. Hats off for ur work apple keep up the good work.
283,4,Value-for-money,"Everything is perfectly fine except the display quality and night mode in camera. If there was a amoled display in it and night shot capability, nothing could have been better.  Snuggly performance and butter like smoothness are simply the identity of IOS."
284,5,Highly recommended,I upgraded 6s to I phone XR mobile performance is superb good ... but in Flipkart while we are pursuing its showing 10 days guarantee but there is no return the product after purchased 1 day the mobile price dropped to 39900 feeling bad...
285,5,Great product,"Fabulous device,this is my first iPhone and I’m in love with it already. Good service from Flipkart got it just after one and a half days after ordering"
286,5,Terrific,best phone bit heavy but really worth battery life is really good am really satisfied with phone delivery shipment prompt
287,5,Just wow!,Good phone and Good seller. Classic Awesome Red Colour.
288,5,Brilliant,One of the best mobile. Battery must be stronger than present.camera quality is good. Touching sensors working very good. my overall experience is amazing. Thank you flipkart for you fast delivery service.
289,5,Wonderful,superb phone .Design is very good and very slim.Smooth feather touch display and no lag .There are some new features but not many differences than iphone 6 or older models .Good battery life.What i like is touch sensitive is too good and face id is working perfect .Initially you will miss the home button if you have upgraded from iphone 7 gradually you will be adjusted to the phone and what i find is with out home button phone is great and multitasking also working fine .
290,5,Brilliant,Excellent product. Good deal with Flipkart.
291,5,Perfect product!,Camera Sample is here guys  It gives more than i expected as a entry level iPhone

347,4,Value-for-money,Happy to hold and feel iPhone xr.....grt price offered by Flipkart But am really disappointed to say Flipkart PPL make tempting offer for ur old phone with higher exchange value......but while exchange the delivery guy finds a minute scratch.....very negligible colour fade on the bottom of the phone and he demands the remaining amount to be paid else he will return I guess we should keep a new unused phone for exchange which should have no scratches or any thing like it Better to buy in nearby stores even though if it's bit higher in price
348,5,Brilliant,Awesome mobile

384,1,Utterly Disappointed,"PLEASE DONT USE FLIPKART E-COMMERCE PLATFORM - BOLD AND CAPITAL - Delivered a faulty iphone XR - screen not working with soft, hard and factory reset, Apple service center advised to return but still Flipkart ""interrogates the customer - where, when, why, how!!!"" - working professional like me would suffer between equations of Flipkart vs Apple vs seller - Filpkart even do not have customer support sync where they foolishly call to check if product is working despite raising a complaint - pathetic platform and extremely horrific customer service attitude. I don't know if seller is genuine also....AFTER SPENDING 40K, YOU'RE ON MERCY OF FLIPKART AND THEIR LOUSY CUSTOMER SERVICE ATTITUDE & NO WAY TO RECOVER MONEY OR GET EVEN A REPLACEMENT TILL THEY CHOOSE TO RESPOND!!!"
385,5,Super!,"it’s a very powerful device . osm camera quality, battery durability is also good"

407,5,Awesome,Brilliant Device. Charging is coming for 1 and half day. Price is a bit high. Camera is not quite up to the mark. Performance wise it’s a beast. No heating issues. Packing is poor.
408,1,Worst experience ever!,"The brand new iPhone XR went dead within 2 weeks of purchase! After spending so much money in buying a top of the line product, one doesn't expect this. And I'm left stranded without a phone while dealing with a personal emergency. Further, the Apple help line or service centre are not open on Sundays. I expected more from Apple if they're serious about the Indian market and if they have to charge a premium for their products."
409,5,Must buy!,Great

418,5,Super!,Thank you Flipkart
419,5,Brilliant,An awesome phone with awesome features…
420,4,Pretty good,Great phone and I loved it. However I feel cheated on the flipkart pricing as you reduced the price from Rs.42000 to Rs.38000 in just 10days since I bought
421,5,Mind-blowing purchase,Good product overall camera is the best
422,5,Fabulous!,i upgrade from android mobile into ios everything is awsome in xr with respect to previous phone i used except battery backup i previously used samsung a71 redmi k 20 so i am used to use a phone with great battery backup so only this is uncomfortable
423,5,Terrific,Device is very nice and performance is too good. If you don't Required 2 camera for specially showoff the must go with iPhone Xr. Display size are same as iPhone 11.
424,5,Best in the market!,Just awesome
425,5,Wonderful,Take the iPhone XR in place of iPhone 11 bcz at the end of the day u will save money from XR as both are not 5G phones
426,5,Highly recommended,Good product thank u flipkart
427,5,Mind-blowing purchase,Best phone for gaming under 50k
428,5,Simply awesome,"Was very happy with the purchase, after so many prolonged videos this was the best choice ever🥰"
429,5,Awesome,Best iphone in this price 👌 I love it 😍💯
430,4,Good choice,The product is genuine and services is good but only problem is that the Flipkart shows the high price when we add an exchange phone but when the dilevery boy arrives at home he offers such a low price. This needs to be improved.
431,5,Highly recommended,Amzing phone juss wroth it!😊
432,5,Classy product,Everything is Gud but apple should include a fast Charger in the box
433,5,Excellent,Awesome phone ...🤗🤗
434,5,Awesome,"Phone has awesome battery life, ios experience good potrait camera and complete iPhone experience. Glass designs looking beautiful."
435,5,Awesome,Awesome phone . Got 128 gb in 46k
436,5,Terrific purchase,Original product. Working fine. Never seen fastest delivery before than this even when it was raining in Mumbai.
437,5,Classy product,Awesome ❤️❣️
438,5,Worth every penny,"My first i phone, also my first phone bought from my own earnings, apple has it, can beat any flagship phone on the basis of performance, camera quality, battery is good but could have been a bit better, although it was launched back in 2018 still can beat many android flagships. Happy Owner ❤️"
439,5,Highly recommended,Highly recommended
440,5,Terrific purchase,Worth for money!
441,4,Nice product,Value for money and good battery
442,4,Value-for-money,Performance and battery life is awesome. Wouldn’t miss telephoto lense
443,2,Not good,The exchange experience was pathetic. With minimal scratches on my iPhone the executive denied taking my phone and gave me a bad value. What was promised was not given for a phone in very good condition.
444,5,Brilliant,Go for it... I know you will be jumping between one plus 8 and iphone XR Trust me this is a better choice. This phone not only gives u a good performance but class.  PS-Android can never beat ios.
445,5,Mind-blowing purchase,good dvc
446,5,Worth every penny,Bought this for my wife. I use an iPhoneX and this one is much faster than X. Had doubts about display quality as it is LCD and low resolution. Trust me we don’t feel much difference. In fact visibility under sunlight is much better. Even though camera is single it is better than X. Only drawback is that we cannot take portrait pics of objects. It’s algorithm needs human face for portraits.
447,4,Pretty good,If you just want to hold and use it as a normal phone go for it no issue with camera and screen but it's comes with a 5 watt charger which takes around 2 hours to charge that small battery battery drains faster if u are into some online games u have to purchase a fast charger for that doesn't come with a fingerprint that makes it little boring to use you can get a better android device for this money If you are a android user and thinking of shifting to iOS don't do it you will thank me later .
448,5,Perfect product!,Nice product. Camera and performance are very good
449,5,Wonderful,"Perfect product a budget phone Camera, battery,speakers and performance satified really happy thanks flipkart for offer and timely delivery"

480,2,Slightly disappointed,Facing sensor issues
481,5,Highly recommended,"I don’t regret buying this beast in 2020 .Its now a 2 year old beast but powerful. Iphone 11 and xr are similar devices basic difference is camera,battery,performance. Xr signifies its price. I play pubg alot it’s a beast in pubg. I play in hdr extreme but doesn’t lag like other android devices. Best point of apple is apple gives 5 year of updates. Iphone 6s is getting updates it’s a bit old"
482,5,Best in the market!,Undoubtedly IOS is the best.
483,5,Must buy!,Great phone in 2020 even better than rog 3 also u can play 4 hrs pubg on higest setting in xr op phone op performance op battery op camera ip looks
484,5,Terrific,It’s worth spending money on iPhone XR in 2020 too. If you wanna buy entry level iPhone go for this model not for SE 2020. It has everything and will meet your expectations for next 3 year I hope. It’s very well build and feels complete phone.
485,5,Best in the market!,Nice delivery by Flipkart and 10/10 in apple xr
486,5,Fabulous!,"Best value for money product from Apple. Bought it for 43k by using HDFC credit card and with the discount. Whoever wants to buy an iPhone in 2020 and also wanna save some bucks, go for XR instead 11."
487,5,Just wow!,Awesome mobile for pubg player
488,5,Best in the market!,"I bought this for my wife and this is the first time we are using iPhone and I must say it is amazing. I wife is fell in love with her new phone. There are so many things to explore in this phone. She has already spent a week and still hasn't explored all the features yet. According to her iPhone is much better than Android phone, be it a one plus also. Camera, Performance everything is just superb."

491,5,Highly recommended,"Got it for 36K in Big Billion Days , Best IPhone with powerful battery"
492,4,Really Nice,fabulous it's too good display is just like crazy lcd
493,2,Slightly disappointed,The mobile have problem since I bought it. I have recorded some videos and they don't have sound. So please if you buy it check it the moment you get it in your hand.
494,4,MRP is lower then the website showing.,I just got my new iphone but its price is different rather then mentioned in the page. The price got overnight from 49000 to 52500.
495,5,Highly recommended,"Very good phone if you are in apple ecosystem . Because if you consider price to specs , yes there are better performing android phones out there in that price . But if you are picking iphone xr because you use the apple ecosystem and you dont have budget for xs max ,then you are not gonna go wrong with it . The camera is awesome along with the battery life. You are getting the same processor as xs i.e A12 bionic .Gamers would not find any reason to regret.Sound output through the speakers is very loud and clear . Screen quality is not as bad as other people on internet are shouting . I am not disappointed about the screen at all and i feel most people would not have any problem with the screen quality . Very satisfied with the purchase.Its been 3 weeks i am using the phone and i have still not faced any issues.  The only con comes to my mind about this phone is the price, YES it is expensive . If you are ok with it and an apple ecosystem user then just go for it."
496,5,Excellent,Value for money 💯
497,5,Wonderful,my first i phone xr i love this mobile camera and battery Awesome

504,1,Terrible product,I don knw why my phone is giving me trouble....i hope flipkart didn’t cheat and gave me a refurbished item by saying fresh item...coz I phone doesn’t trouble this much n dat too at this early stage l..

506,1,Don't waste your money,Worst product. Don’t buy this online
507,1,Worthless,"Phone worked for the first 3 months perfectly fine. However, after 3 months it started getting heated extensively even without using. Also, I felt shock when I touched the screen when the phone was being charged"
508,1,Useless product,Seem there is some issue with this phone mic. I got many complaints from my oponent. I also tried with wifi calling also.
509,5,Classy product,Amazing phone. I was a little scared before ordering as I had seen a lot of reviews that said screen is lcd and not oled. But frankly can’t notice the difference. Battery life is amazing. Even after full day usage still half battery remaining. Perfect screen size. Go for it.

522,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"Slim Design, overall technical specifications awesome,Worth for money"
523,3,Decent product,Heats up on slight usage. Battery backup is only good when not being used. On continuous usage battery keeps on racing downwards.
524,4,Wonderful,This is my first iPhone. I am very Happy This is value for money in 2021 all time good screen and feature.. Must buy it ❤❤❤
525,5,Terrific purchase,Happy with the product.. Need to use for a long term to write a review. Service and support from flipkart is great...
526,5,Mind-blowing purchase,Its a good upgrade from iPhone 7 to XR.
527,1,Waste of money!,the battery is taking very long to get charged competely a i kept it for charging a 10% and it took 4 hours to get charged to 87%
528,5,Awesome,Nice phone
529,2,Could be way better,"Some time I have network issues(WIFI is not working), I think this is not new product. they are cheating the people."
530,5,Highly recommended,Really thank u flipkart... It is true yes i bought it only Rs 36999.. Thankx alot..... Iphone is iphone what disclaimer you want to know..
531,4,Value-for-money,Good performance but battery is draining quickly
532,5,Fabulous!,Love the I Phone 📱 value of money
533,5,Fabulous!,"1’st of all i want to say about this product is awsm just bcuz i like the cAmera,battery liff,nd the whole performance of the phone😍 in a simple word i cn say that u can purchase this phone without any hesitation 😘🥰😍nd thnx to the flipkart for sending me this loveable phone💕"
534,5,Mind-blowing purchase,Still its a beast in 2021! Absolutely Loved it 🔥
535,5,Brilliant,Just go for it.I got at Rs.34999 at fbb.Definetly worth the money.No android smartphone could be better option at 34999.No battery issue nor display issue
536,5,Must buy!,Nice apple
537,5,Great product,"Thanks to the A12 Bionic and chipset and lower resolution, the battery performance is great, making it the iPhone that could comfortably get through, trust me it’s worth buying in 2021"
538,5,Terrific purchase,"What I yearned for all these years, I could buy...thanks to Flipkart Sale. As for XR, who am I to comment when all the tech gurus have recommended it even for the year 2021!"
539,4,Wonderful,Average
540,4,Value-for-money,Display and sound is great... if you are upgrading from android at initial stage you will find some difficulty but later on you will enjoy the iOS and one more thing your WhatsApp data will be lost on moving from android but the main issue is with charger you will get a normal usb to lighting cable and a 5w charger which charge the phone very slow. The phone is capable of fast charging but you have to a buy fast adapter and a type-c to lighting cable which will cost you approx 3k if you will go with apple original... so before upgrading take time and think
541,5,Best in the market!,Good phone camera quality awesome I am happy
542,5,Wonderful,Still worth it in 2021
543,5,Brilliant,It’s a best value for money phone if you’re looking for Apple and you have a tight budget you should go for XR
544,5,Just wow!,Instead of buying iphone SE 2020 go for iphone XR

563,5,Terrific purchase,"I was a skeptical for buying this. But then, went ahead and bought after reviewing from the feedback here as well with some other reference!  I was bogged down by a few negative comments ..  Let me tell you, The phone will delight you with its tone and texture!  Go for it 100%."
564,4,Wonderful,Fully satisfied. Good one. Camera quality and performance is also good. Don’t think twice. Just go for it.
565,4,Really Nice,"Awesome performance, value for money"
566,4,Worth the money,Product wise everything fine from Flipkart..but coming to delivery service worst experience i have faced..better to improve your delivery services Flipkart
567,5,Super!,"9-Dec-2019: The mobile is really good. Everyone knows the available function. I'm here to tell my experience. The mobile functions very smooth the only drawback is the MiC, the voice is not that great for the person who is receiving my call."

Battery backup is awesome, camera is good(night mode, ultra wide and potrait for objects or pets not there). Display is good. i only faced issue is when i switch on the internet from eSim and again switch back to physical sim the internet stops working, u have to restart the phone."
571,5,Mind-blowing purchase,Excellent ! Don't doubt about the display .. even i have seen many review videos about it . No need to worry its absolutely fine u cant recognize the difference . All other features are good and the battery life is insane you are really gonna love it ! you wont regret after buying this iPhone XR .
572,5,Perfect product!,It’s really an amazing phone but the only con is the price is high otherwise it’s good
573,5,Must buy!,Potrait mode osm best Phone battery backup excellent overall very good value for money 😘😘✌🏻🍾
574,5,Perfect product!,Portraits are WOW But missing Ultra wide and night mode Overall beast in every specs Thanks Flipkart For amazing offer on Xr
575,4,Pretty good,"Received Black 128 GB two days ago, replacement clause withdrawn by seller. Very poor packing by seller. The phone is a very good, specs are awesome. Shifted from android to iOS so getting used to. Camera and battery power is very good. Recommend to go for it."
576,5,Highly recommended,"In one word it's Awesome. keep in mind if you have an iPhone, you have an I phone."
577,5,Classy product,"iPhone is out standing. iPhone XR battery, built Quality, screen are out standing"
578,5,Terrific purchase,nice mobile it's value for money thanks flipakart
579,5,Best in the market!,"Awesome Phone with great specs. Although the screen is LED, you don’t find it different from OLED"
580,5,Classy product,Phone is good 👍👍👍
581,5,Terrific,"First off, the battery life is INCREDIBLE! This is the first phone I have used where I can get two days of use on one charge! I would regularly charge the ..."
582,2,Not good,"Camera is very good and performance is awesome. charging is slow, overall very good mobile at this price range. Xr is my first iPhone."
583,1,Utterly Disappointed,Was charged more than MRP mentioned on phone. Multiple complaint also does not resolve the issue. Flipkart hasn't refunded additional amount charged yet even after multiple follow ups.
584,5,Classy product,Very nice superb product
585,3,Does the job,"I bought XR 128 gigs red variant with 10 percent HDFC discount. Delivery is slightly took more days. Packing is neat and good. Its recently imported phone. Performance is snappy and clean. Camera is good. Battery life is awesome. I get around 8 plus hour screen on time. Its way too bulky and weighs more. The main problem and serious problem is, it has got reception problem in LTE and WiFI. Signal strength sucks. I am kinda confused what to do. Have done a online research and found its common in XR model, since apple uses inferior intel modems in XR models. The problem is not persistent in XS model since it uses a superior modem. Apple thought XR is a really cheap model in the line so did this trade off which is considered a primary hardware an any smarphone. My oneplus 3 is too good to recieve LTE data whwn i campare both phones side by side. Any help will be appreciated. Thank you."
586,5,Fabulous!,I loved it but the battery is always the big problem...
587,5,Best in the market!,"Nice Handset, Battery Backup aswome, camera quality too good"
588,5,Highly recommended,Nice product
589,5,Great product,Awesome product.
590,2,Moderate,"Bad rating is not for the phone, phone is good I like it a lot, but for the delay it took Flipkart to deliver. Also the sale price and normal price is same now. Flipkart is just trying to fool people. I will never buy from Flipkart again."
591,4,Pretty good,Go for it
592,5,Super!,"The product is excellent.  Normally people think why to invest so much when other options are available with similar features in low price. But the product quality and it's performance can only be felt once it is in hands. It's really "" owners pride, neighbours envy"" Utility for money. Loved it"
593,5,Terrific purchase,This is my first iphone.... I'm Very happy to purchase from flipkart....
594,4,Wonderful,1st time using iphone and i love it. I gave 5* to the phone but i’m disappointed that it didn’t comes with the bubble wrap.
595,3,Does the job,"UPDATE  Don’t buy from flipkart. I really doubt the quality of phone sold. I am facing so many issues with my phone. The ram management is very poor. It can hardly keep apps in memory. Everytime I open an app in memory, it refreshes again. Also, I face issues with connectivity to wifi. Many times it doesn’t autoconnect to wifi if connection broke in between.  I loved the camera. Only think I don’t like is the time it takes to charge. It takes almost around 2 and half hours to completely charge. I always have to leave the phone on charge at night because during day you hardly get time to charge."
596,5,Super!,Best iPhone for the price I got it for 39999 worth it. performance is so gud. heard that xr battery last long than any other iPhone serious but actually it's normal. phone weight is to heavy. over all the phone is osm just osm. if u want to by a iPhone for cheap price go ahead with xr.
597,3,Fair,"Awesome handset, Camera is great. Battery backup is nice it works whole day in a single charge. only thing that bothers me is the bezels of this phone, even after this is a full screen phone i has a very thick bezel on all the sides"
598,4,Good choice,superb and cool product.
599,3,Decent product,"Pretty average, 15k for phone, 25k for brand, I am coming from android background, can tell you for sure iOS is useless when compared to android when it comes to user friendly interface. - keyboard is nightmare - sound control is hopeless. - Bluetooth pairing is headache. - lack of free apps. - battery is ok - only advantage is at any point of time there is no lag in using the phone or switching between apps. This is only +ve I found.  PS: though I did not pay for the phone from my pocket (my company sponsored), I still regret it waste of money and should have gone for some decent android phone."
600,5,Super!,Great experience with I PHONE XR .. Camera ❤️❤️❤️ I love it
601,1,Very poor,VERY BAD experience !
602,5,Mind-blowing purchase,Honestly i was bit sceptical about the display quality but it turned out great! Writing this review after using almost 12 months. Never had a single complaint. Everything is perfect. Being an avid gamer and pubg player I bought this phone and it has never let me down. I’ve decided to stick to iOS 13 bcz it runs games smoothly compared to newer roms! The only drawback is the heating but well every other phone heats so cant really complain
603,4,Pretty good,Outstanding images in daylight. Battery is far better than se and iphone 7 and 8 plus. It is similar to iphone 11. Performance is op. No lag in Pubg and COD. Don’t go for iPhone 11. It will give you same satisfaction.
604,2,Could be way better,But product price dropped so much just after my purchase & battery is taking 3 hrs minimum to get fully charged. But other aspects are nice
605,5,Mind-blowing purchase,Wonderful phone. I don't take much photos so lack of dual cameras doesn't bother me. It's a beast.
606,5,Classy product,Nice
607,1,Unsatisfactory,Not buy iphone in this cast any other company good mobile you can take its battery work at list one day but iphone xr mobile batter will be not working if you are using continuous means it will decreases within 5 hours 100% to 0% other nothing problem battery only disappointed
608,5,Excellent,Awsm product by apple super..
609,4,Very Good,Superbb mobile in this year 💕💕💕
610,4,Worth the money,Guys phone is fine but don’t buy mobile phones from flipkart. I asked them to pay through my credit card but at the time of delivery the swiping machine didn’t work. I had words with flipkart executive but he asked me to cancel the order. I had to pay the whole amount in cash. Also i didn’t get “lightning connector” as it was mentioned on the box but still it was not it inside the box.
611,5,Fabulous!,Good phone and proformens is best
612,5,Terrific purchase,My First Iphone Amazing experience with Ios
613,5,Best in the market!,Great phone....surely better then last year’s iphone 10 and better value than 10s.
614,5,Simply awesome,"awesome phone, great performance, thank you apple and flipkart"
615,3,Good,Idk why but its battery % jumped from 100 to 96 in 1 day after like 15 days
616,5,Brilliant,Have been using this phone since june 2021 and i am really happy with the battery life Quality display Overall worth the buy of an apple product
617,2,Bad quality,The battery is worst. The battery capacity is falling very rapidly and the customer service just resets the phone and gives it to you saying they can’t do anything about it. Now I really regret buying iPhone XR.
618,5,Best in the market!,Nice backgrounds
619,4,Delightful,"As good as iphone 11. If you are not too fussy about dual cameras, you can go for this one and save about 10k. Super performance as always. Camera is great. Both front and rear."
620,3,Fair,It's price around 42k rupes and looking at his performance not satisfy with it.If you thinking to buy this XR for Gaming or BGMI then don't go for this go for 11 or upper or if you have tight budget then you can buy this also
621,1,Worst experience ever!,Loud speaker when in call is not working properly.. Sound on call is also very very low
622,1,Did not meet expectations,Mobile is heating after on of hotspot& battery performance is also not good
623,1,Terrible product,Don't buy in flip kart west off the money
624,5,Terrific purchase,Must buy.. its soooo smooth😍😍
625,1,Utterly Disappointed,Found issues like Overheating issues after using few months. Extremely unsatisfied with this product & flipkart service I suggest not to go for such products. Flipkart team need to take care such things.
626,1,complaint,PRODUCT COMPLAINT IT'S NOT WORKING PROPERLY
627,5,Classy product,I loved apple 👍🏻
628,5,Excellent,IPhone will never let you down as the quality performance everything is just above all.. I've purchased 3 iPhones from flipkart and honestly saying I'm really happy with flipkart..Thank you
629,5,Terrific purchase,"Actually apple dont need review, if you want to go for apple budget phone go for iphone XR....."
630,4,Very Good,Value for money I was skeptic about switching to iOS from android but after getting used to it now I can’t go back to android.
631,4,Value-for-money,Charge was very late better to purchase 20W fast charger
632,4,Good quality product,Good phone but it is weighted ..battery backup is very nice..
633,5,Terrific,Battery is very low
634,4,Really Nice,Camera quality is not so good. Expected better Rest all is ok. Charger need to buy seperate of 20W. 5W is useless as it takes 3hrs to charge
635,5,Simply awesome,It's Good
636,5,Classy product,Excellent phone but not screen guard included and back case too...
637,1,Terrible product,"Am device test engineer am strongly telling you all not to buy iPhone XR.. if u are living in rich areas u will get network signal 70 RSRP, so u will never face issue but. If u are living in moderate area sure RSRP 80above so the MIC starts giving issue Like other end people who is talking with you can observe that your voice slowly get decreased and after 60sec only voice will come again Especially this happens when you turn on Volte  I have given in apple for 3time , 3times device has replaced but same issue then only I started research with all my friends who have iPhone XR everyone tells yes but we thought it’s network issue"
638,5,Just wow!,Thanks for the Flipkart
639,5,Terrific,Osm build quality...😘😘
640,5,Excellent,I like it so much ❤️🤩🤩🤩
641,5,Fabulous!,Still worth in 2021
642,4,Phone is Great but little upset with Look of the package,Phone is great but when I opened the phone it had all dust at the sides of the screen and at the back as well. So im not sure if this was a new phone or removed from the display counter and given
643,5,Super!,Great experience with my first ios device
644,1,Horrible,got this product within time but the product is not working properly. Touch screen is not working smoothly. Phone is hanging. Screen start working itself without my touch. Tried to replace but flipkart didn't allowed and asking to go to service center. Bad product from flipkart
645,4,Wonderful,"Solid Clean Heavy  Good performing daily drive that you can depend on even in 2021 and i guess this would be sufficient for 2022 & 23.  The display is the only downside for this phone but thats on paper, on daily use you would barely notice that."
646,5,Just wow!,Awsome Product Mainly That it includes charfer and earphones....
647,5,Excellent,Bought for 36k worth buying
648,4,Very Good,Screen is not very responsive with every screen guard. You may need to try multiple.
649,1,Useless product,The product was not upto the mark and I doubt uf it was original. Trying to connect apple care to get it fixed / replaced. My first iphone and pathetic experience with XR

669,5,Terrific purchase,I am satisfied my 3rd iPhone amazing I am surprised I love Apple products
670,4,Delightful,Premium phone but not for average people. Handling difficult compare to Android. All Android app not on ios. So transition from Android may not be smooth. Many apps which were free in Android are paid in ios.
671,5,Awesome,Suberb Product...You can order it online no worries. ..
672,4,Wonderful,Everything was Cool
673,4,Pretty good,Simple...best iphone by desine and look...

678,5,Great product,"My mom gifted this on valentine's day, got this product for 37,999. Everything's great on this phone. Thanks Flipkart for one day delivery."
679,5,Brilliant,display saturation is low as compare to Samsung...battery is good ....performance is opp...difficult to use in starting 😅😅...
680,5,Mind-blowing purchase,Excellent product
681,5,Worth every penny,"I am using it from last 2 months, overalls performance is good, one issue i observed that some phone was not wake up during call (make a call and keep phone with your ears sensor will keep the screen off when I remove the phone from my ear screen is not glowing, generally it should be glow)"

686,5,Best in the market!,Product is awesome & genuine. 5 star for Apple . Zero Star for Flipkart....... they have delivered it in 60 days...... they postponed delivery date every 15 days & no information from Customer Care about exact delivery date ..... on date of delivery Customer care guy told to wait till evening then dramatically date postponed to 15 days.... what a pathetic customer care & Flipkart is worst

689,5,Terrific purchase,Awesome camera Best for gamers

691,5,Terrific,Charger adapter is hit
692,5,Terrific purchase,I am using it for about a year now and honestly saying that it is a different experience. Performance is just top. No lag no frame drops. For gaming and video editing it is so reliable. Video editing upto 4K 60FPS. Battery is not that grate but sufficient for 1 day moderate use. Video recording has no competition at all. So even in 2021 it is worth buying it.
693,5,Worth every penny,supb camera battery backup evrthing is supb 👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻
694,5,Terrific purchase,best phone and i got it for 36k loved it
695,5,Excellent,If you’re a iphone fan go for it. Camera is great. It pixelated when i tried zooming it much. Other than the battery is better what I have heard from other Iphone users.

763,4,Very Good,"This is VFM as long as you want to buy only an iphone. The display is below avg for the money but coming from a OnePlus 7 the contrast is comparable. The ppi is sufficient. Performance is good Battery is great for an iphone , above average in general. Camera is avg in low light but good under lighting. Supports 18w and wireless charging. I use it with slow inbox charger. Takes 2 plus hrs for full charge."
764,5,Terrific,My fav was xr coral.. so I chose that..
765,2,Not good,Battery backup is really bad.I you are switching from android to iphone then it can be a real struggle for you.

782,5,Super!,"PROS: High Quality Display Best battery backup in an iphone Resolution is not bad. Still Retina. Superb Audio through Speakers, Bluetooth and Audio dongle. Audio improved after iphone 4s. Apple flagship thumping and crystal clear sound is back (using with RHAT10i) Excellent Build Quality Primary camera is good. Call clarity is excellent E-Sim / Dual sim is handy Stable network reception  CONS: Front Cam could be better Notch could be smaller to increase screen space No headphone Jack No Aptx HD for high Resolution Audio streaming through bluetooth Slippery Glass body- Fragile"
783,5,Brilliant,Awesome.. 1st time using IPhone and I am impressed... Thank you to Flipkart for Fast and Safe delivery
784,5,Fabulous!,"Its a great investment, however don’t go for exchange offer with flipkart, as they won’t take it if there is a single spot on phone. Unexpected but harsh truth. But go for Apple don’t even think twice. Get the hell out of Android now.😂😂😂"
785,5,Must buy!,BEST
786,1,Waste of money!,No earphons and no charging cable no dock
787,5,Must buy!,Awesome ❤️. Just go for it. I am very happy with my decision for buying XR. Thnks to Flipkart ❤️
788,5,Must buy!,Awesome phone
789,5,Fabulous!,I bought this phone and got it for 47k during Apply Days Sale. Absolutely value for money you can get. Nothing comes close. Really enjoying music from the stereo speakers. Loved it! Camera 5/5 Battery 5/5 Speakers 5/5 Display 5/5(not comparing) Performance 5/5 Looks 5/5 Feel 5/5 Built quality 5/5
790,3,Nice,Camera is not upto mark specially in little dark. Picture is not that available in othet low budget handset.
791,1,Terrible product,"Unable to download my official applications, 😢 Gone Waste. If you want to show off go for it otherwise go for Android phones with great features on same price. Battery life is worst didn't expect that from iphone."
792,5,Terrific purchase,Good product fast delivery
793,5,Mind-blowing purchase,So far so good
794,5,Terrific purchase,Only one word Fasak
795,1,Horrible,"Phone is not working, no backing up from icloud, unable to set up and there is no return option"
796,5,Iphone xr,I love it
797,5,Super!,Just go for it .
798,5,Terrific purchase,Great product
799,1,Useless product,"After updated iOS 14, facing touch issues, struking issue.. first time feel wrongly purchased in flipkart"
800,5,Terrific purchase,"Superb Screen display, compare with S8 side by side, this would look gorgeous, S8 may get weaker as days go by but XR would dominate. Seeing the new Iphone 11, its seems better to go with XR or XS, right size phones fit in your hand and pocket."
801,5,Perfect product!,"I have purchased this phone on 1st Jun. and the phone turned out to be faulty. Flipkart has refused to give any support foe the 55000 phone which has a big manufacturing defect!! whenever I start the camera app it makes a flickering noise, tries to focus on the object and fails to do so and gets abnormally heated near the camera portion. Feels like my fingers are going to burn! Once I switch off the camera, the device becomes normal.  Update: So finally Flipkart has replaced the defective device and its looking like the current product is okay and working normally. Thanks Flipkart. However, Apple should do proper quality tests with their products before placing it in the market for sale! These are expensive products and we don't want to waste our time running for the authorised (?) apple resellers to repair a brand new phone that has a manufacturing defect since unboxed! Apple has NO RIGHT to ask the customer to visit an unauthorised Apple reseller (That's the only thing we get in India from Apple, since they don't have a genuine Apple store in India) with the defective phone and rather they should replace these defective phones right away, no questions asked!"
802,5,Simply awesome,1st Iphone... Camera n Display is just mind blowing. It's lit bit tough for a android user to make it handy but yeah it will take 4 5 days then you gonna fall in love with this Iphone
803,5,Classy product,Nice product assume thanks Flipkart I just buy in 36999 with EarPods charger and cable
804,1,Faulty phone,I bought this phone in the month of October and today suddenly it got switch off and not able to start it. Its not even a year and the issue has arise. Are you guys selling faulty phone?
805,5,Awesome,"As expected from Apple, the performance is excellent and battery is mediocre. I would not recommend this to someone who's a heavy user because nowadays we have options of 6000mah battery. However for Apple users it's not new but, the product is value for money. Try to get this deal below 39K, and they release multiple apple offers in a year."
806,2,Could be way better,Camera is worse
807,5,Terrific purchase,Nice Product 👌🏾👌🏾
808,5,Classy product,Reviewing after 7 months of purchasing.Best phone to purchase if you’re on a tight budget. Everything is excellent.
809,5,Classy product,"Product good but no finger print option, instead of this face lock option having it work good."
810,4,Value-for-money,Excellent phone Loved the iPhone XR!! Only problem is needs two times charging in a day for heavy internet users .. rest all are good Otherwise a good product from Flipkart Thank you Flipkart
811,5,Highly recommended,Very good phone
812,4,Good quality product,"Battery backup is not good. If I watch any movie or videos on YouTube or any other website, battery is draining from 100% to 20% in 3 hours and it is taking much time for charging. Apart from these 2 problems, everything work’s smoothly."
813,4,Wonderful,Phone is good but over priced and Kangna uses iphone but how her chats were leaked
814,5,Awesome,"First switch from the Samsung flagships to the iPhone. I must say the build quality, UI and the performance of iPhone XR took me by surprise. Its too early to comment on battery backup and performance, however I am looking forward to a positive experience just as my first impression"
815,5,Best in the market!,Excellent :)
816,5,Just wow!,Nice profuct nice series
817,5,Great product,"Worst display quality I’ve ever seen in a smartphone, Don’t go for it, Better to get OnePlus 8T."
818,5,Must buy!,Very good product...
819,5,Awesome,Awesome product Thankyou Flipkart
820,5,Excellent,Value for investment ♥️
821,1,Terrible product,"Don't buy these phone please. I have very normal usage of 2-3 hours of phone. I have bought this phone on 18 october and today is 4 november. Its only 17 days and my battery health gone 99% from 100% and I am using apple original charger of 5w. Instead my friend bought iphone 11, his daily usage is of 7-8 hours of gaming while using some duplicate fast charger. Still his maximum battery capacity is 100%. Very upset with the apple iphone."
822,5,Simply awesome,You can still buy XR in 2020 even in 2021 bcoz it will always be a value for money device.
823,5,Just wow!,Excellent mobile with amazing camera and very good battery backup

828,2,Slightly disappointed,Not so good.. wasted my heard earned money..battery ans canera not upto the mark.
829,5,Simply awesome,Overall the phone is good Just sometime it doesn’t ring during a call
830,2,Could be way better,Defective product at first. Took quite a while to get a functional replacement
831,5,Terrific,Everything is good except the charger stopped working on the 3rd day. So Now I have to go to the service Center because of someone’s fault.
832,5,Brilliant,"It’s bulky compared to X and XS, however it does the job. Good camera. Takes time to charge, could be better with fast charge feature."
833,5,Wonderful,the phone looks great. you should go for it. however you must keep a track of the courier facility
834,5,Perfect product!,So happy with this product thanks flipkart.
835,5,Wonderful,Awesome i would recommend this apple phone 😍..! January 2020: I now have a problem with face recognition..! 🤦🏽‍♂️

979,5,Worth every penny,"This is the best phone. It has 3gb ram which equivalent to 6-8gb ram on an android phone. Apart from slow charging due to the default adapter, this phone has no flaw.  At first you may think the video recording is not recoding the sound, but that is because of the plastic cover. If you remove the plastic cover, the video recording will work fine.  The Flipkart service on the other hand was very good. They called and asked me if there is any problem with the phone just before the returning period was about to over."
980,5,Terrific,Nice

996,1,Did not meet expectations,"Horrible experience with iPhone xr. Software issues, received faulty product mic not working properly. Other person not able to speak properly. Severe heating issues. Dealer send faulty product even after exchange. Box arrived with seal broken. Given compliant to flipkart but to no use. I hate iOS phones. Android are much better. Waste of money. Not worth it. Don't buy from Flipkart otherwise dealer send the faulty product. Bad and worst experience. Third class phone compare to Android phones."
997,5,Terrific purchase,Too Good
998,5,Wonderful,"I bought this phone a couple of weeks back and this is how I felt about this product Let me be clear, as an iPhone user you shouldn’t be expecting the features form the other brands at same price point but the quality and privacy of the iPhone is always bench mark. If you are a heavy gamer or mobile photographer you can go with other phones at this price.  The phone build quality is picture perfect with premium glossy metal and glass body. Phone is water proof with 1 meter, 30 min resistance, But I personally don’t recommend you to use it under water as the water damage won’t come under manufacturer’s warranty. The phone camera is okayish but not a deal breaker as it do not show fake colours like other china brands. UI is very smooth with no lag or bugs and very responsive.  The biggest turn off for this phone is the absence of finger print sensor. It comes with face recognition lock.As in 2021 we are living with masks it is bit annoying to type the passcode every time."

1051,5,Super!,This iphone is excellent & my first experience in this iphone is too good.
1052,4,Wonderful,Performance is good as far as you can expect from apple. I find it little bit on heavier side as compared to my other smartphones. Low light camera quality is ok ok for front and rear. Specially front. It takes almost 2.5 to 3 hrs to charge from 10-100%.
1053,5,Best in the market!,"Value for money iPhone in the recent years. Bought this for my father. It has LCD display, if you want OLED display then you need to buy iPhone 11 Pro, 11 Pro Max or iPhone 12 series."

1064,5,Just wow!,It’s been over 2 weeks using this mobile and it has so far been a tremendous experience. I’m simply loving iOS. The camera is top notch. The display is very fluid and buttery smooth. Battery back up is excellent on this device. I find only 1 negative and it’s the lack of night mode in camera and the lack of Ultra wide angle camera. Other than that... no complaints! Happy to buy XR and it’s damn worth it!
1065,5,Awesome,I got it at 36K which is very competitive. In US it retails for $499 so Indian price in offer is excellent. Would definitely recommend at this price.
1066,5,Awesome,Awesome

1132,5,Just wow!,Awesome battery life and perfect camera and good performance
1133,1,Hated it!,Not satisfied with Battery drainage issue and cellular signal strength
1134,5,Terrific purchase,Just awesome 👌👍
1135,1,Waste of money!,"Hi the product I received is not genuine, phone is ok, but the headphone is not working from very first day,"
1136,5,Wonderful,For the price I got at 38k this is quite good. Always go for flagship which is 2 years old vs current mid range. I choose this over other android mid rangers which are of similar price
1137,1,Worthless,There is some issue with the touch. Sometimes it lags.
1138,4,Really Nice,It's my 1st iOS mobile nd it's experience is good.. It's a good 1 if u want to switch to iOS ..
1139,5,Great product,Terrible ❤️❤️❤️

1141,4,Nice product,The product is like a fresh. Value of money. Really good seller to buy.it also contains a 1 year brand warranty.
1142,5,Excellent,I am using Samsung Galaxy S8 before buying this iPhone. But S8 display was Super Amoled display. When I am using this after S8 I am badly disappointed about its display. Otherwise 100% satisfied about apple and it’s all products.
1143,5,Super!,"Performance wise, nothing to say... It's still beast in 2020... It can runs pubg on HDR + Extreme graphics at 60 fps constant 😁 but camera... Personally I'm not a big fan of it's camera... Video quality is quite awesome when recording at 4k 60 fps but photo quality is really poor... Also display is similar to iPhone 11. So don't get confused between iPhone 11's display and XR's display... Both are same"
1144,4,Delightful,Good Quality best working better than iphone 11
1145,5,Worth every penny,Superb

1151,1,Utterly Disappointed,"display is too warm even after toning turned off, camera performance is below poor, features are very basic"
1152,5,Fabulous!,Very good product ameging phone
1153,5,Perfect product!,Nice phone thanks flipkart
1154,5,Worth every penny,"After using for a month I am thinking that why didn't I buy the iPhone 11. The camera on this phone(XR) is very good.  Initially I thought most apps don't support, but that's a hoax.  Pros: Brand value Great Looks Build Quality Superior Network Reception Display Brightness can be lowered to a great extent If you are using another Apple product then the intra device connectivity is hassle free.  Cons: Battery Life could be better Face Id doesn't always catch you NO fingerprint sensor Free 5gbs in iCloud whereas 15gbs in Google"
1155,5,Brilliant,Satisfied
1156,5,Terrific,"Worth the price, but always go for 128gb varient"

1189,5,Super!,"Litteraly this is a very poweful product and the speed of the A12 bionic chipset and the battery life of the device is so amazing. I am using the android phone from last 8 yrs this is my 1st iphone and the camera is literally amazing, don""t underestimate this department. I take photos very randomly and it gives a very good result. it doesnot have any dedicated lowlight mode but if you take photos at night it gives such a good result but make sure if u want to take photos when all lights are off it gives you a very black picture but if you are want to take some nature photography, potrait photos(of a human) or normal night photography and a powerful cheapset for gaming or day to day life usage you go with this device in 2020 and literaly this device is so poweful and no lagging issues."
1190,5,Brilliant,Camera quality is Osm
1191,1,Unsatisfactory,They are not friendly to return the product as i am asking to return the product in this situation.
1192,1,Worst experience ever!,My problem is when I am selecting primary sim the calls goes from secondary and when I select the secondary the calls goes from primary. Don't knoe why this issue happening feeling like using an iPhone made by xiaomi😩
1193,3,Just okay,Overall the phone is pretty good but it's 2020 and you're giving people a 5 watt charger to charge their phone which takes almost an eternity for a full charge!

1361,5,Worth every penny,What to say about Apple product.. Guys I got this 128 Gb model at approx 54k with HDFC offer and old smartphone exchange.  pros Battery backup of 2.5 days .I used to use iPhone 6 earlier and battery used to drain quickly and by the time I used to reach home at night battery percentage used to be roughly 20%.But XR battery is superb lasts long. Camera portrait mode is fantastic.   Cons heavyweight of 200 grams approx. loud speaker could have been a bit louder but it's ok in silent room. see image battery was charged yesterday morning and still 38% is left.So happy to be owner of XR.

1379,4,Worth the money,"The phone’s awesome. The eSim creates a nuisance though.....especially with Jio eSim. What I’ve observed is that if the signal drops (like in a lift), then the eSim signal does not come back till you move the phone into airplane mode & back (or restart the phone). That’s lousy.  And we can’t use two WhatsApp’s ☹️"
1380,1,Waste of money!,"Battery is really third class.. it comes with 5 watt charger. you need to charge upto 3 hours. It will work for a day, if you are not using phone much. Heat by using 2-3 things together like music, maps, bluetooth. Waste of money"

1388,5,Terrific purchase,"It's very smooth,as expected from Apple A12 bionic chip, really Apple iphones' are not costly for nothing ,just awesome far better than cheap brand like vivo ,oppo ,mi."
1389,2,Not good,pls. take back. my experience is very bad this phone
1390,5,Must buy!,Grt.... A happy purchase
1391,5,Brilliant,Nothing can be better than this😍😍 It’s a beast💪💪
1392,5,Best in the market!,Osm
1393,1,Terrible product,My edges were damaged
1394,3,Fair,I think iPhone XR is overrated. A very avarage cameras. It stands nowhere against Oneplus 7 picture quality honestly. I can show 100 pictures I have captured. Rest good looking phone.
1395,1,Terrible product,Came with a faulty charger cable need to go to apple store to replace it and also iOS 13 was pre installed out of the box i have a doubt it may be a used phone
1396,4,Good quality product,Best budget Iphone ..i got it @ 36K..ultimate deal
1397,1,Very poor,"Horrible product, very much disappointed, should have waited for oneplus."
1398,1,Worst experience ever!,Camera is just a piece of Crap. Don’t buy this product. Network reception is very worst and your voice can’t be heard to other person everytime you call. Battery is also not up to the mark. Front Camera is like VGA quality. I don’t know why people are overrating this product as just wow.
1399,5,Super!,Charging approx 2 hr then 80-85% and camera quality is poor than other phone like s9..
1400,5,Classy product,Apple phone purchased but back camera not workings. Sir phone replesement
1401,1,Unsatisfactory,I took mobile before 5 months and it already broke
1402,5,Perfect product!,Amazing
1403,5,Excellent,"Awesome image quality, well performance,"
1404,1,Not recommended at all,Phone get heated when we waching video online.   But my samsung M30s heat less than iphone.  This is really disappointing me.
1405,2,Expected a better product,Battery problem not good 100% charge drain within 5hrs
1406,1,Waste of money!,Not included adapter and earpods for black colour For red silver colours with same price they included power adapter and earpods why this difference for same products with different colours
1407,1,Terrible product,"After hearing a lot about Apple Product. Somehow I managed to purchase my first apple product from my savings and I have been using this phone from past 1.5 years. Experiencing heavy hanging of the phone while usage. I though of purchasing storage of 50 GB per month charges basis in order to manage hanging problem , I clicked on the backup on iCloud, my phone started hanging more abruptly with screen blinking and unable to switch off now. God save my phone. Unable to solve this problem, even google/you tube might not be able to find this kind of problem on apple iPhone XR  Really its better to buy any brand phone than buying this phone"
1408,5,Worth every penny,awesome product thank you so much Flipkart and all flipkart members
1409,2,Not good,It starts hanging in 2days. Battery is not long lasting.. ..only camera is good
1410,1,Did not meet expectations,From last one year back camera isn’t working
1411,5,Wonderful,Power stuffed
1412,1,Waste of money!,Its been only 3 months and my power adapter stopped working. Really Disappointing
1413,1,Utterly Disappointed,NO QUALITY PHONE
1414,3,Good,Camera & Battery could have been better.
1415,3,Does the job,Hopefully it will work well
1416,1,Very poor,The phone ran smoothly like a butter until it didn’t !! And this is not the first time I’m facing this issue. My last ip7 had the same problem. Both the phone died while I was on the phone and both had a battery of ~80% when they died! This one died when it was still under warranty!! Apple quality has dropped drastically
1417,4,Good choice,Phone is very good. Only issue I saw from a week's usage is the heating problem during charging and viewing videos for more than a hour
1418,1,Worst experience ever!,Garbage
1419,5,Just wow!,I had iPhone XR black and wanted to buy another one for my wife and confused in colours and in last ordered white colour and it’s looking more beautiful than black one.. everything else is good that’s why ordered my second one
1420,1,Absolute rubbish!,"Don’t buy this product. It’s pathetic. I’m facing so many issues with Battery and Charging Wire. They’re saying it is not included in warranty. I’m literally struggling. Don’t make the mistake which I made. Once you buy it, Apple will not own anything of it. You’ll have to bear all the problems and their cost on your own. Please don’t go for it. I wish if I could give it a 0 star rating."
1421,5,Worth every penny,Best iPhone ever! I already own a XR got this one as a backup iPhone and it’s stunning and perfect! 10 out of 10 rating! Thanks Flipkart for original product!
1422,4,Good quality product,Now company is not providing charger and ear plugs with mobile. Otherwise APPLE is APPLE. I love it.
1423,5,Terrific,Nice camara ❤️❤️❤️ Nice display 😍😍😍 Thanks flipkart ❤️
1424,3,Nice,"I would suggest to avoid basis on my experience. 6 months past purchase, this device hangs and slows down. Comparing to other models used, I think this device is the poorest in terms of performance. I have never faced an IPhone earlier which has a delayed response time or freezes. This does. Missing my IPhone 5S , best I have ever used"

1446,1,Utterly Disappointed,"Flipkart sent a defective piece, total wastage of money pls dont buy this product"
1447,5,Must buy!,Best in class. If you have a little less budget for iPhone 11. Go for iPhone XR it’s very close to IPhone 11 and will not at all let you down
1448,5,Brilliant,Value for money and also battery pickup very well
1449,4,Delightful,Very good performance and batttery
1450,4,Very Good,Good I phone but overheating issue is observed while doing video call after 5 min
1451,4,Worth the money,"Excellent device at this price range, though it's 2 years old but still can survive for next 3 years. Display could have been better."
1452,5,Highly recommended,"I had doubts in buying via flipkart, but I received new packaging latest box and phone. Ofc as stated while buying it will include earpods, but i am satisfied with my purchase m and authenticity. Lets see how it works."
1453,5,Great product,Using from 8 months with 8 hrs screen on time and still left with 100%battery health💯

1458,1,Useless product,I faced Touch problem (in 5th months).......and I claimed warranty and they replaced touch display combo......but I m not satisfied in that
1459,5,Just wow!,Suggest those who have used only Android earlier not to switch to Iphone it's a hell for them... I am.currenrly repenting for the same... The mobile.is awesome... Screen is not that great since my earlier device.ROG 3 had 144 Hz display...  Battery backup is very good for a small battery lasts me all day...  I would suggest everyone get a hands on to the device and then purchase
1460,3,Just okay,Don’t buy if u want strong battery backup and gaming otherwise it is amazing for normal use
1461,1,Useless product,Never bought this from these sellers not from Flipkart please I got trap in this.

1468,4,Very Good,nice product better than se2

1484,5,Classy product,Ohh it's amazing  It's so Expensive
1485,1,Hated it!,Battery health got down by 1percent before 2months bad move from iPhone
1486,5,Brilliant,Just awesome. .. guys people will just scare u by saying that it’s battery is bad will die soon etc but trust me it’s better than some of the android phones and rest is all u should feel it once u own it.
1487,5,Awesome,Great product
1488,2,Bad quality,charger and mobile is heating
1489,4,Very Good,"My first iPhone , 5w charger is not good enough to charge this phone .it takes approx 3 hrs to full charge.12w charger will take 1 HR to charge this phone so I ordered that too.  Performance and camera quality is awesome."

1511,3,Good,Overall performance is ok. But the touch screen beside the notch portion is sometime is not responsive. It needs improvement .
1512,5,Brilliant,Apple does not need any review.it is already best.just go for it.
1513,5,Classy product,No comments
1514,4,Good quality product,"As for protection is concerned, Could have provided a temporary screenguard atleast, along with a back case."
1515,4,Good choice,This is the 1st iPhone we have bought. Now we know why it's difficult for anyone to switch from iOS to Android. Even though it is costly but it is a complete package. The only con as per me is the weight. Rest all it's the best flagship phone anyone can buy.
1516,5,Excellent,You use it and you forget android completely its true
1517,5,Highly recommended,"Probably best iPhone in these price range, except Display nothing is compromised."

1539,2,Moderate,Mobile hanging problem
1540,2,Bad quality,"High Price but no Fast Charging Facility, you need to spend more money to buy the fast charging cable or adapter, limited features, over rated product, no glass display...not satisfied with the product..."
1541,5,Must buy!,My first iphone. Truly amazing. Very good camera and battery. Battery charging speed is very low. Have to spend another 1800 for apple fast charger to get the device charged in 2 hours. Eveything else is superb.

1552,1,Absolute rubbish!,Bakwas phone .. moved from Android to iOS... Feels like a generation backwards.
1553,2,Slightly disappointed,I was under the impression that iPhone would be much different from rest of the phones but was disappointed. It is no different. Battery does not last very long. Camera not very powerful. All in all there is nothing great about it. I can’t understand why it is so expensive.
1554,5,Brilliant,Nice products
1555,5,Fabulous!,nice phone. worth for money
1556,4,Worth the money,"the front camera is literally bad . but the back one is love ,overall it's good but the battery life is still very low ."

1569,5,Awesome,Its chinise
1570,3,Fair,Never expected such a unfair camera performance... OnePlus is much better than this phone camera... Really disappointed with camera performance.. and still there is no update for camera from Apple
1571,1,Did not meet expectations,Sometime i feel it is a clone device
1572,5,Excellent,Nice picture quality
1573,5,Best in the market!,Product best choice
1574,1,Did not meet expectations,Totally hanged device shame on u Flipkart n apple brand😡👊👈🏻

I have another iPhone 11 but that works just fine and infact it’s older than this XR. It’s battery life is at 96%"
1576,3,Does the job,Not good not bad very heavy heat this phone
1577,2,Moderate,Don’t buy anything from Flipkart specially during mahasales period i feel cheated right now after using it just for 3 months now my battery percentage is 99%
1578,1,Waste of money!,Difficult to operate. Not User friendly. Not good performance as per price. It's just waste of money. Screen is not wide. Words are not visible due to short screen..... Apple!!! It's Not Epic version. #*BOGUS PRODUCT*#
1579,5,Brilliant,Great smartphone
1580,5,Fabulous!,"Great phone, original, worth the money"

1585,5,Terrific purchase,"Best phone,"
1586,3,Just okay,Battery health decreases by 5 percent within 2 months of general use in general environment. But overall performance is well I m writing my opinion after nine months of use 👍🤘👌
1587,5,PERFECT PHONE EVER,SOUND .BATTARY ALL IS AWESOME AND RED LOOKS ARE JUST SPEECHLESS BEAUTY
1588,5,Perfect product!,Worth the price.Blue is beautiful.

1598,5,Must buy!,Very good and best performing phone from apple love it
1599,5,Excellent,"It's Apple. So no questions on overall quality. It's just that XR could have been more better from camera and screen resolution/pixel density standpoint. Photos come out pretty well but could have been better. Battery backup is good in XR. Sound is loud, crisp and clear. It is fast and processor does the job well. So, that's it."
1600,4,Wonderful,Everything things are great but slightly heavy
1601,5,Simply awesome,One should always experience it
1602,5,Wonderful,Value For Money Phone . For people who are looking for Apple Products but donot have the obsession of owning the latest one. Functionally not much difference between it's elder ( in terms of price ) siblings
1603,3,Does the job,Everything is fine except IOS. Hopeful to switch back to my Galaxy soon :)
1604,3,Just okay,WiFi is automatically on in morning. I am facing the issue from fast one year

1609,5,Mind-blowing purchase,Quite a good phone.
1610,2,Expected a better product,The phone is having problems continuously. The volume has gone down within 3 months and the battery life is really bad. I feel flipkart sold a duplicate product
1611,5,Classy product,Awesome
1612,1,Unsatisfactory,"Review after 10months,ghost screen and poor battery backup ,front cam joke camera and hotspot not working properly worest mobile I ever saw even 5k and 10k other mobiles are best comprare to this"

1614,5,Great product,I like it very much
1615,5,Worth every penny,Good camera quality
1616,1,Not recommended at all,Colour damage in 10 months and not accepted warranty. I don't think you should buy mobile online
1617,2,Could be way better,Battery backup has reduced within 6 months

206,5,supreme product,"The specs on this phone are just insane. Check the benchmarks for this beast... This is THE MOST powerful phone on the planet right now. No wonder it costs a bomb.  I would recommend it to anyone who is a performance enthusiast and doesn't want to settle on build quality. There are Fords that produce 500 bhp and then there are Mercedes that produce 500 hp. There's a reason why the latter costs 5 times as much.  Samsung S6 edge+ is the only phone that can compete with this beast, but the iphone is just too classy and the build quality washes away Samsung's efforts."

0,1,Waste of money!,"Team, Today only I received my product - 29, May, and below are pros and cons.  Good Point: 1. Very quick delivery 2. Better clarity compare to Mi and UV 3. Easy to handle and lightweight just 6 Kgs  Bad Points: 1. Not having AUX sound connectivity, it has Digital Optical Audio Output which is mostly not available with general sound system 2. difficult to share the mobile screen with this TV since OnePlus connect android App don't work on all mobiles 3. The Installation team will come after 8 days of delivery to install the TV and explain the feathers and if you are not satisfied and you want to replace this TV you will have only one day left. 4. Looks wall mounting stand comes with a cost, which is an additional expense for the user."
1,1,Very poor,"Within 4 months pitcher panal is not working properly, Engineer is come and check but last 10 days haven't received any response or solution, west of money, don't bye this product"
2,1,Terrible product,This is sub standard TV. I have TCL TV purchased last yr. With same confirmation and clearly TCL is much much better.  Drawback.. 1. Slow connectivity via wifi 2. USB. No last memory. Every time ull have forward which is very very slow 3. Picture clarity stands no where when compared with TCL 4. Screen cast/ mirroring is pathetic. It just keeps hanging.  Overall... its frustrating experience.  Go for TCL instead of One+
3,1,Don't waste your money,One plus to improve display panel quality...
4,1,Utterly Disappointed,My led tv picture suddenly off
5,1,Hated it!,"TV quality is not a good, sound issues and TV is also hang many time Technics come and problem solve but next day problem re create....such a bad TV...I am really told you don't purchase this tv and don't waste your money for One+....Baddd"

10,1,Did not meet expectations,"The worst tv everseen,, waste of time,, i would like to give my two suggestion to all 1)picture clarity of this tv is totally waste, myself giving input - movie 12GB size movie, but the output in the tv is 400mb movie size clarity,, 2) The speaker quality is really worst, voice clarity is as childish one having 5 to 7 years baby voice. Bluetooth speaker (cost may be Rs.250) is better than this tv spaeker. I request you to provide atleast Bluetooth spaeker quality,,, waste of money"

Picture quality and audio output was good 5. TV remote was also good 6. TV takes 15-20 seconds to boot. 7. Overall okay. Did not reach my high expectations of a OnePlus TV
455,3,Does the job,One plus is undoubtedly a good brand to choose..sound was very good...but d picture quality axpected lill more clear...if ur setup box is having hd connection then its amazing but in normal mode it was not satisfactory.... settings options must be user friendly
456,3,Decent product,Average TV In This Price Segment
457,3,Good,My experience with OnePlus phone is pretty nice same I expected from TV but TV is far low. Picture quality is average and some time when watching HD content can see lag in picture. Sound quality is poor. Some time TV is slow and take long time to turn on.
458,3,Does the job,All is great but picture quality is not so good
459,3,Good,"Installation is chargeable for Rs. 299, picture quality is ok sound quality is awesome"
460,3,Good,"Picture quality is good , sound quality could have been better"
461,3,Decent product,Bought it 12600 Cons Picture quality average. Blur and looks like 3rd class display. Even crt tv has better display. I recommand lg or samsung. You can't cast your mobile. It is very difficult to connect. There is no screen cast option in tv. If anyhow you cast your screen then it lags very much. Tv hangs frequently.  Installation is not free. Technician takes 400 rs for installation but other companies take no charges.  I have returned this led tv.  Pros Only bezel less display  Finally i say go for samsung or lg. Don't buy oneplus /mi/realme
462,3,Just okay,"I was delivered the TV on 4th June 2021, installation happened on 7th, so this is my review after 1 week of usage  Pros: 1. Panel is good in terms of color reproduction, contrast 2. Bezel less 3. WIFI connectivity is good (not checked for LAN) 4. Bluetooth connectivity is good, connected speaker and were working fine 5. Remote is ok, never dropped connectivity over Bluetooth with TV 6. Boot time is average (30sec-1min) could have been better 7. Audio is loud enough for medium size hall  Cons: 1. Should have given Android 10 to exceed in competition, not sure is upgrade will happen 2. Software lags at time, but experienced this occasionally 3. Audio has no bass 4. No 3.5mm jack leaves connectivity restricted to Bluetooth, this can be an issue if you want better audio experience and your sound bar or speaker setup lacks Bluetooth 5. Most importantly, viewing angle is good only if you are viewing within 90-120 degrees, moving farther will degrade the color and experience  Who Should buy: 1. If your budget is close to 20-21k and if you get this product on that price then 2. If you are 1+ fan"
463,3,Does the job,After using 6 month. My review is very change of this product and services. This time having issues this product.When switch on TV taking more time for Starting.

558,3,Nice,"Genuine review motorola 32 inch vs one plus 32 inch. Overall not as good as expected🙄. I bought motorola tv from flipkart and now i got one plus tv. When compared both of them, one plus is nothing when compared with motorola. Both tv's are having 20 W speakers but the motorola speakers are like bomm......boom..... but one plus is speakers are not upto the mark😐. Picture quality is also too good in motorola tv while one plus has nothing much to offer. But, motorola tv got a biggest con!!!! Tye remote doesn't work and sometimes motorola tv acts on it's own even if we don't use remote. So, you have to turn off the tv and turn it on again. Motorola tv will make you anger and test your patience but on plus tv got a amazing connectivity. Even if motorola offers best sound and picture quality, i suggest one plus tv cause even if you got in amazing features in motorola, it's remote doesn't work and sometimes act on it's own. I thought remote is not a problem at first but i watch netflix, amazon prime, hotstar all the time. So, it doesn't work for me and i finally smashed the remote in anger. Finally, it's your wish to make a choice. I recommend on plus tv!!"

Dnt know what are the usb ports whether usb 2 or 3.0.. no information any where...Google duo is not working with OnePlus TV camera also... Apk installation is not suppporting for some applications such as zoom even we installed camera. Major issues are connectivity and VERY MUCH LAG IS THERE... BOOT UP TIME IS getting MORE N MORE as the days are going.. means it can not handle the load of apps... FINALLY ITS AN OK CHOICE FOR ME FOR 20K...

579,3,Oneplus TV has serious design issue,"Overpriced average product. This TV has a serious design issue as it has visible black spots on all of its 4 corners. All oneplus did was that it increased the color saturation levels and advertised it has wider color gamut. No difference in this oneplus TV and a non branded generic chinese 32"" TV.  I got this one for 13250Rs with 2 offers on HDFC credit card so for me the value i got is fine but for the current price of 18999, its not VFM. Go for samsung or realme full HD 32"" TV instead."

640,3,Decent product,Hangs frequently. Remote doesnt work in timely manner. Sometimes it Switches on using any button. And many times it take a lot of efforts and switching off from electricity to get it back up and running. Hanging problem is there. A good suggestion would be to buy a tv and firestick separately. I have this configuration in another tv and that never causes issue

679,3,"Go for it, only if you're okay with the compromises","I'm totally new to the smart TV's as my old LCD TV lasted around 5 years. and 5 years ago only few were making LED and they were costly. since my old LCD TV is dead, I decided to go for LED Smart TV this time. Let's start with the pro's: 1. Bezel-less design: You'll get complete screen. you won't loose pixels because of the large bezels. 2. Gamma Engine: You'll get wonderful videos with vivid colors. 3. 1080p supported: when you purchase a TV at this price range, we'll more likely get 1920*768p. but this tv supports 1080p video output.  Now let's discuss about con's: 1. You'll need a wifi router to cast your mobile to TV. 2. Chrome cast consumes a lot of data while casting. so you'll end up spending a lot of data for casting. 3. Mira cast is not supported. which is why you'll need a wifi router to do chrome cast. 4. Weak Design: they just pasted the frame with the display. since it's bezel-less display. so instead of bezel holding the display. it's just a glue which pasted between display and frame. when i first got the tv there was a small gap found between tv and the frame. so i got it replaced. 5. You can't use this tv as a bluetooth speaker for your mobile phones. only way to play your music on tv is casting the mobile display to your tv. 6. there's no separate button for audio only mode. so if i play some music video on a video player, i can't able to put it on audio / music mode. 7. There's no music player apps for android tv. so you had to play the music with media players only (Ex: VLC)  Verdict: It's a good upgrade from a LCD TV. but still, I still don't find this not so useful. I still cast my mobile to laptop and connect my laptop to a tv using HDMI to listen to music. I still had to connect my laptop to my tv using wires since there's no mira cast. only difference is, i used to play my multimedia contents using my STB before i got this tv, now I'm playing my multimedia contents directly on this tv. so, if you have a perfectly working LCD TV, keep your tv and don't go with this one. because i didn't find that much of a difference from my old LCD TV. but if your old tv is dead and looking for a new one go for it."

732,3,Good,"Hi recently purchased the 1+ Android TV but the 1st TV tha was delivered for faulty and had a huge gap between the screen and the external pannel on the edges. Raised a Replacement request and the 2nd TV was sent. This one didn't have any external issues. But then a FireTV stick connection was not established with any of the HDMi port, there are two ports. After some struggle the connectivity was established. The Casting worked during the installation but unfortunately it hasn't worked since then. I have raised a request which is yet to be resolved. I am told it could be potentially due to poor WiFi connectivity, which I peoved is not the case. Now after a week the FireTV Stick doesn't connect to the TV Audio, I have to switch it off and restart the TV to get it connected. Again not sure what's the issue, will have to raise a request again. I am not sure if others have faced similar challenge but elaborating it here for benefit of people who may have faced or will face in the future."

1161,4,Good choice,"There is a significant lag in the connectivity to the TV remote is slugish in the 1st few seconds. As its powered by Android there are slight lag in the UI. But the UI is well thought out, the bluetooth seems working perfect, the clarity of pictures are amazing to the price standards. Remote is easy to use and the voice recognition is 8/10 The TV does drink a lot of your data, so make sure you have adequate WI-FI. The TV automatically connect to the closest Wi-Fi, You can add multiple bluetooth speakers wirelessly to the TV. The Sound itself. Coming from the TV has a lot of Trebble, but it's not that bad. The TV does not come with a wall mount, it only has its TV stand. The bluetooth receiver for Remote to TV is awkwardly placed below the TV, so you'll have to do a lot of adjustments if your using the remote above a certain level. The TV came in a well protected box and the TV tech sent by flipkart who came and helped us with the installation was also good.  Value for money 8/10 Sound 6/10 Bluetooth connectivity 8/10 Remote and voice recognition 8/10 Power consumption 3/5 Picture clarity 7/10 TV UI 9/10"

1706,5,Terrific purchase,"At this price point, the TV is good to have with easy connectivity and setup. Picture quality is good for the led screen(however you can compare another tv in the same segments). The sound is good although Dolby impressions I couldn’t get in the first use(perhaps need to check more). Remote is clean and minimalistic and easy to use. Connectivity is good, able to connect to wifi via router and hotspot and the connection stays and works perfectly fine. Able to use any streaming services without any hiccups. All possible Apps for streaming are available to use and Chromecast is there to cast from supported Android phones and also YouTube iOS app from iPhone has the feature to cast it as well. OnePlus connect option is there for OnePlus phones but need to check how good it is."
1707,5,Terrific,"It is superior TV. Working on android pie .You can also use Oxygen play interface for a content centric view. It has good voice command Bluetooth base remote control.

1714,5,Terrific,"This review is after long-term usage of 6 months, the video quality on this TV is really good especially in this range- the color production, and sound quality is good too...you can really enjoy watching series on this TV. It is really light and there is virtually no bezel- the design is really good! The remote is really simple to use and lightweight, and the user interface is smooth and easy. One great thing about this TV is Oxygen play where you can find all the content in one place....and can search content across all OTTs here. In all this one is a bang for the buck."
1715,5,A Good One from your home. Go for it.,"First things first, I have purchased OP Y 43-inches smart TV @ 24K- it's a great deal for me. Apart from it, this TV is one of the best smart TV's out there in the market that you can get. The User Interface is clean and doesn't lags while operating the tv. Also, the picture quality is up to my expectations.  The after-sales is also great. I got my TV installed by a guy named Sonu from Jeeves. He was highly professional and explained all the features of the TV."
1716,5,Wonderful,"Delighted view, and Great Experience. Only point which applies to all Smart TV is that they need wifi Network close to Device, they dont work so good with Signals coming through walls. But this problem Is with all companies"
1717,5,Terrific purchase,"Best Budget friendly smart tv one can buy, although the video quality is not at par with that of samsung/sony but the sound quality is seriously amazing 💯. Easy to install and use !!"
1718,5,Super!,Feedback (Dated 15 Feb 2021) Ordered on 12th of Feb and got it delivered just after 2 days. Till now it's functioning very well. It's a best choice for whom who are switching from CRT displays to LED TVs. In comparison to other 32 inch LED TVs in market it's a value for money also.
1719,5,Wonderful,Delivery was on time and installation before the expected date . The picture quality Awesome and sound Super quality . This is my 1st 1+ we as family liked a lot. Thank you Flipkart. As always your Awesome.
1720,5,Terrific purchase,OnePlus Smart Android TV 43 inch is the best budget smart TV from a premium brand like OnePlus. The video panel used in this TV is mind blowing. It is even better than some other 4K panels. The colour is rich and clear. The build quality of the TV is also very good. This TV is truely bezelless and looks very very premium. Android TV UI is very smooth and responsive. It also has Bluetooth and wifi connectivity which is very useful feature. I am very satisfied with the over all performance of this TV.
1721,5,Simply awesome,Nice tv with a great picture quality and good sound system Have a feel of a premium tv with baseless design Overall a perfect tv in this range  Looking for a tv with good picture quality sound system and value for money .... For sure go for it ⚡
1722,5,Just wow!,Best value for money 32 imches tv available in the market! The picture quality is amazing and the sound quality is also satisfying. The OS is the best in the market. The software updates are undoubtedly the best in the segment. Loved the TV. Highy Recommend
1723,5,Great product,Thank you Flipkart for delivering tv in this situation just within 2 days and one thing that surprised me was installation within 4 hours. I was extremely mind blown with the service in got. I had uninstalled flipkart as I was not happy with it 4 years ago but reinstalling and trying it again was worth it.Another Great news is NO cost EMI upto 9 months from Flipkart on purchase of TV. This is just Wowww!!! Thanks to the delivery agent and installation guy who did thier job flawlessly.
1724,5,Classy product,OnePlus Smart Android TV 43 inch is the best value for money LED TV available in this price segment. After doing a lot of research I finally decided to purchase this TV for my home. After using this TV for few days now I have to say that I am very impressed with the over all build quality of this TV. This TV looks very premium and the display is just gorgeous. It also has bluetooth and wifi connectivity. The remote comes with google assistant built in which is very useful feature. The sound output is also very good. All major content provider apps are pre installed and works flawlessly. I am very happy with quality and service provided by OnePlus and flipkart.
1725,5,Fabulous!,TV is beautiful with minute bezels. I was pleased by the picture quality in first I expected a smooth software from oneplus but TV operation is bit slow probably due to 1gb ram and lower clocked processor. Can't complaint at this price point. Wish oneplus would release better optimized software in update. Software update was one of my reason to buy TV from oneplus. Response from the bluetooth remote was bit slow.
1726,5,Best in the market!,"It's a good android TV, doesn't support all the apps in the play store, If you need to plug an USB make sure USB is in NTFS. Sound is good for a small room, There is a connectivity issue, while connecting to phone."
1727,5,Perfect product!,Value for money I used Last one month Picture Quality was Awesome and no issues in connectivity because of OnePlus Connect App. Sound Quality was decent for that price range. 1GB RAM & 8 GB internal memory it's not enough for heavy users like gaming. Overall Nice Product from OnePlus
1728,5,Wonderful,OnePlus has recently launched their Android LED TV in India and according to customer reviews it is providing best value for money smart LED TV at very reasonable prices. I finally after a lot of research purchased this 40 inch OnePlus TV and I am very happy with the over all build quality and performance of this TV. It looks very premium and elegant. The piano black colour looks very good. The video quality is superb.
1729,5,Great product,It had amazing picture quality! but they should increase sound quality and fast connectivity. Best product in less prize.I just want to say thanks to flipkart for a good product. I wish i can give 10stars to flipkart 😉
1730,5,Mind-blowing purchase,Nice quality 😍
1731,5,Terrific,Larger size and quality is so good 😎

1733,5,Super!,"Adding review after one month of use : Pros: 1. Picture quality is value for money. 2. Sound is outstanding. 3. Connectivity (wifi, bluetooth, usb) is smooth.No issue faced till. 4. Bezel less almost.So can enjoy content flawlessly.  Cons: 1. UI is laggy sometime. 2. Switching between apps or content takes time more than expected sometimes.  Overall overview: In this price range,this tv is more than enough you can get.Everything you got is Excellent.If that laggy UI thing is solved,then the experience will enhance further more. Wish OnePlus can fix this through regular update."

1862,5,Simply awesome,Everything is as expected except one thing. Pros: Remote solves all your needs. Connectivity us good. Almost all apps are pre-installed. 4k picture quality is damn good.  Con: There is no 3.5 audio output to connect your TV into an old sound system; one needs to buy an optical cable and optical to analogue converter in order to utilise an existing stereo system. And it's costs you dearly...rs 3.5k to 6k. Could not understand why r they eliminating 3.5 audio options!
1863,5,Worth every penny,One plus is a best in the market thanks to flipkart

0,5,Terrific purchase,"This is a detailed review after 7 days. Please read this if you have problem or concern regarding sound/picture/brightness/sd channels/wifi connectivity/miracast. PICTURE: the picture quality is really amazing. Blacks are really deep. Contrast is pretty good too. No complaints there.  BRIGHTNESS: tv is pretty bright, by default dynamic light is on and it will make your screen dull, just turn it off. I've set it to 25. No screen galre problem.  SOUND: tv speakers doesn't have much bass, ideal For a small room. For larger rooms or halls, hometheatre is recommended. Also by default sound output is extremely low, you have to manually adjust equalizer. And still the sound would be low for streaming apps, for set-top box sound is good and loud too.  SD CHANNEL: the SD channels looks amazing, the upscaling of this tv is mind-blowing. No complaints there, but you have to use Hdmi cable, normal av-cable quality looks poor. Also don't connect older set top box hdmi 1,coz its hdmi(arc), you will encounter sound issues.  WIFI: I had a lot of problem wile using wifi, but a very simple solution was to turnoff data saver. Then wifi worked like a charm. This is bad if you plan to use your mobile hotspot. The wifi range is pretty good too. My router and tv are 40ft. Apart and it still works without buffering. Also, there are about 3 walls between router and tv.  MIRACAST: it's gonna hang if you'll use mobile hotspot to cast to tv. I used one plus 6t hotspot and it lagged. If you have a router installed, then use that network, I didn't feel any problem using home network. Although there was minor lag which is acceptable.  Hope these solutions help.  Now some openions:  I played 4k60fps video from pendrive and it played without any problem. No lag or buffer was noticed.  I used jio cinema and jio tv app without any problem, but jio tv is not recommended, as the streamed quality of sd channels is extremely poor.  The bluetooth remote has a pretty good range too, I've used it as far as 30fts.  It takes around 1 min. For this tv To boot up. It's just annoying to wait this long.  You have to manually press switch on button on remote too every time you turn on tv from switch. That's just annoying.  By default, youtube playes 720p videos, you have to manually set to 1080p every time. That's just annoying.  That's it for now. I'll edit it if I find new findings. Hope this helps."
1,4,Very Good,"I m posting review after checking all it's functionalities and settings in 40inch version. Below are the summary points : * Display : looks decent. 4k and full HD content looks satisfying. casted content dispaly quality is below par (also depends on the content you are casting). bezels are thin and are made of plastic which is loosely attached to the display panel. viewing angles are good covers around 150° * Connectivity: impressive , connects to WiFi, Bluetooth , Chromecast smoothly. observed some glitches with Chromecast when the screen just froze on the tv while the content was changing on my mobile. * Patchwall : provides good interface and helps choose from good variety of content available. * Sound : is impressive and feels quite smooth even at higher volumes due to dts hd technology, though dolby sound could have made it better. Netflix, hotstar , Amazon prime etc : it plays smoothly and provides immersive experience. * Installation: installation was prompt, I received tv on Thursday and installation was done by Sat. installation guy was knowledgeable but tried to sell stabilizer at a higher price to me, I declined the offer to which the person said the tv can get faulty if you don't use stabilizer, I could not find any such condition in the product detail so I denied using it.  To sum it up it is above average TV at this price loaded with the benefits of Android with decent picture quality. *Area of improvent would be in contrast ratio and color reproduction. if you liked the review do hit the like button. Thanks. Edit 1 : Thanks for 1k upvotes. Adding some more points after completing 1 month usage: * Netflix ultra HD content gives you really good viewing experience. * Remote is very handy, but difficult to type something when you want to search anything on tv since it does not have alphabet and number buttons. but you can make use of Google assistant here by directly speaking your requirement in the remote and it works buttery smooth."
2,4,Good quality product,TV good smart and in SD box little bit of pictures dim. we use HD box after good quality came. YouTube and hotstar super quality coming videos
3,5,Worth every penny,Best TV range........ money on valuation the great picture quality and sound quality more..📲🎶📺🎶🎧this is range in the best choice mi buying tv. also was nice Go For it....
4,5,Awesome,"Super and good quality full HD ,Internet also speed connecting ,it is like one smart phone .full happy and it delivered so speed"
5,4,Delightful,"This Mi TV is superb and value for money . waiting for 10 days just give feedback untill now there is no issues Pros 1.picture quality 2.sound 3.smart TV 4.wifi connectivity and voice search cons 1.no Netflix and some important apps  Installation feedback 1.The installation was good the technician explain good but he force me to give feedback for him at that time and he is not even request me, he asked my mobile and wants me to open gmail and he typed the feedback for himself and finally asked me to acknowledge the feedback and give. 2. he is too fast to explain about the TV. finally I told him please explain slowly for customers anyway I can watch some YouTube how to videos but what about people those who don't know that thing 3. he canvas me to buy stabilizer that he brought.customers should be informed that the technician will bring stabilizer. I bought that because anyway I had a plan to buy stabilizer for my TV it is good for LED TV"
6,5,Simply awesome,"Awesome TV go for it......Lovely sound,video quality is also good and my suggestion is go for hd set up box......Nice delivery and TV installed on the next day of the delivery...I'm happy with it..."
7,5,Wonderful,"Bought this model in Jan 2020 ... So my review would be for the latest model you will be receiving , hope it will help you ...  So Firstly , out of the box i got the remote with Prime Video and Netflix button ... the product description on Flipkart does not mention Netflix and Prime Video support , but after the update it does and Mi is providing with the latest accessories . ( 5/5 )  Secondly , i read a lot of review about Chromecast not working .. But my Chromecast works fine . There is a bit lag though due to my internet connection , my connection is 10Mbps and i stream HD quality videos on YouTube , Prime Videos without any lag . (4/5)  Thirdly , display is ok and sound is good but i cannot complain about those because at this price range it is a steal . ( 4/5 )  I was going for samsung initially but i ended up getting this one due to the price and Android TV . Samsung's Tizen OS is optimized and fast but you can do a lot more in an android device and the number of apps is high due to the play support .  So i give this product a 5/5 rating just because the value you are getting at this price point .  I can totally recommend this to anyone and it does have Netflix and Prime videos so don't be skeptical.  Hope this helped"
8,4,Nice product,I love this MI tv good quality with affordable price. it supports 4k video also especially dolby audio is too good suggestions : MI should give the wall hanging stand for free of cost
9,5,Awesome,"Amazing , super cool , awesome too good😍"
10,5,Highly recommended,Good product . Best value for money Android smart tv Timely delivery & proper installation done on schedule date . Thanks to FLIPKART .
11,5,Wonderful,excellent tv 😎😍😍😘😘😘😘in love with it..full paisa vasool..screen cast also works well .installation guy is so polite and explained all very well😍😍😍..go for it without hesitation...you'll certainly love it😎😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍❤❤❤
12,5,Terrific,"MI is just awesome, obviously value for money. connectivity is super and no flaws noticed in TV till now. if anyone is looking for buy a smart TV in reasonable price then just prefer MI 4A. And finally thank you Flipkart 😊"
13,5,Best in the market!,awesome tv worth every penny...jst go for it...i am really thankful to Mi for such a wonderful tv in such a low cost..thanks to flipkart for quick delivery and best installation...
14,5,Terrific,it very nice mi tv good condition valuable for money but installation tv to late jeeves. pictures quality good .sounds effectively nice. can the the mi tv in flipkart it great delvery it on time it amazing
15,3,Good TV for price but needs improvement,"Pros: 1. Good Price 2. Good Clarity 3. Light Weight 4. Sufficient loud Sound. Though for good theater experience you will have to buy external speakers of your choice. 5. Fast delivery and installation.  Cons: 1. TV legs are of cheap quality, non-durable and risk to use. The TV might fall from it very easily. 2. TV remove is very basic. No QWERT keyboard. I guess for Smart TV people will browse and type hence the Mi remote doesn't serve purpose. moreover it should be an air remote else frustrating to browse/type with it. You will have to buy an QWERT air mouse which means another 1200 to 2000 expense. 3. No Wall mount provided with TV. The Mi brand wall mount which Flipkart service engineer brings costs Rs.500 but it is not of good quality nor its adjustable (i.e. doesn't go front, back, left right etc). Hence you will have to buy a wall mount of good quality which will come for Rs. 1350 and above for 43 inches TV. The service engineer also brings a third party wall mount but doesn't give bill for it. Hence they might be overpricing and selling it to customer. Flipkart must keep a check on this. 4. Ram of 1 GB is not sufficient. I guess it should be 2 GB at least for a Smart TV else software goes slow when you install apps. 5. Internal memory of 8GB is not sufficient because only 3GB is left over for installing apps . 7 GB is occupied by Andorid OS it self. Hence company should be fair enough to tell its only 3 GB internal memory rather than saying 8GB. Once you start installing apps the TV becomes low in space tend to operate very slow. 6. No support for popular apps like prime and netflix. 7. You need really strong wifi connection to watch 1080px stuff online on this TV e.g. Prime installed through 3d party side doesn't play videos at all if there is low wifi connection."
16,5,Excellent,smooth work good picture quality good sound good connectivity but you have to pay 400 more for wall mound during installation.
17,5,Awesome,"It's really a vey very very excellent product at this price range. The patchwall, android interface are very handy to use. Even the wifi connectivity, USB plug in, apps installation is fast. The remote of this TV is the most cutest thing you might see. Only 12 buttons and pretty handy to use. The google voice is also very accurate to detect you words.  Only the stands are a bit shaky only if u want to have the TV on a table or standing position. On wall it is very firm.  The packing and delivery was good and we got the demo service on the very next day so no issues regarding seller."
18,4,Nice product,"Delivery (by delhivery courier) and installation(by Jeeves) is perfect in Rangia, Assam. Picture quality could have been better but ok for the price for a smart TV. Sound quality is good. Work well with WiFi for YouTube videos. @note :There is no direct single AV button in remote for oldage people to use dth/cable content."
19,5,Awesome,"picture quality is superb. Android smart TV in this price segment is unbelievable. Flipkart service is average but the installation is too late. But this is my best TV. I like it. I am from a very backward place ( Kaliadinga, Nagaon, Assam) and it's the only smart TV of my place. Now we the entire villagers enjoys IPL in this mi TV. Thanks."
20,5,Terrific purchase,India's No. 1 Smart TV Brand😍😘 Picture quality and Sound quality is Excellent and internet Connectivity is also Nice Wifi is available in This . i Really like This Smart TV. Hotstar also available.
21,5,Awesome,wonderful product with the less price range. picture quality and sound quality is awesome. I have seen many feedbacks about prime video and Netflix apps not present by default. but I was able to install these 2 apps thru Aptoide by downloading apk from one of the YouTube videos. So I am able to watch prime video movies as well .. overall the features of this TV is super awesome. installation and timely delivery. I loved it . I recommend everyone to buy this without giving it a second thought .
22,3,Fair,"Keep in mind that this is NOT a full-hd tv so picture quality is visibly grainy even if u play a 1080p bluray quality video....I also found the sound to be quite unsatisfactory... of course its the best smart tv you'll get in this price but really just save some bucks and atleast go for a full-hd tv, it will be worth it"
23,5,Excellent,"PRO is better than previous version. It runs on android. Google play store is preinstalled. The remote runs on bluetooth. Great viewing experience as it is true LED TV. HD channels looks awesome, while SD channels does not looks good due to big screen size. Sound is clear and loud enough, good for music as well. Overall its a value for money product. Delivered and installed on stipulated timelines by flipcart."
24,5,Highly recommended,"Really good product. value for money. Smart TV feture are in this price rang wich is great . Picture quality is preeti good , nice view angel. Go for pro model ....."
25,5,Excellent,ordered on 8th march received on 9th march morning installation and demo completed by afternoon!  that was super quick and fast process.  seamless process  tv is working fine patchwall+android is amazing  working smooth even on hotspot ;)  value for money!  i would suggest everyone to do give a thought on buying this amazing TV ...thank you flipkart
26,5,Just wow!,Great performance in low cost...... processor is super first..... mi 4a pro performance is 5 time better then my previous TCL smart tv.Sound Quality is little bite bed... i mean speakers dont hv bass but too much loud 20w speakers. l am using last 1 week thats all n recommend for all who wants to purchase. Everything is Fair&Lovely😍
27,5,Best in the market!,"first time i was confused that mi tv quality is not so good said in the youtube. then i fixed to buy this tv because of its affordable price. then i looked the tv quality,sound,viewing angles. it is superb i had no words to say anything about this tv now. playing 4k video is the best moment. thanks to flipkart 😘😍😘😍 it also has 4k option in YouTube."
28,4,Delightful,"Listen Up, I am writing this review after 5 days of satisfied usage and if you need to justify your hard earned 23K for entertainment, don't consider any other TV unless it's an Android TV. My first MI purchase and I zeroed on it after a lot of research and consideration - The VFM TV in the market right now. And everyone who's complaining about low brightness on this TV, guys 1. You need to first NOT set up your TV facing the window! 2. Go to Settings > display and Turn OFF the ""dynamic brightness"".  And I see people also complaining about selecting the source every time you switch on the TV - You need to dig into the settings and flip the switch on for a few options - Settings > Inputs > ""Stay on the previous Source""  Also, there's a wrong description given on Flipkart which states there is Dual wifi on this TV which is inaccurate. The TV has only 2.4GHz band for Wifi and that's about it, otherwise WIFI and Bluetooth connectivity is hassle-free and the Minimilastic Bluetooth Remote works like a charm.  The USP of this TV is Google Assistant!  All in all a great Buy, go for it!"
29,5,Highly recommended,"Bought MI 4A PRO (43) during Republic Day sale. Delivery was done next day and installation on 2nd day. Service of Flipkart & Jeeves was good. No complaints. Picture quality is really good. I played 4k video from YouTube and its good. No issues with Brightness, you just need right adjustments. Volume is really impressive in fact better than my Samsung 49'' smart led. I don't have dth connection in this TV but wifi connectivity is good. Fire stick does a good addition. All in all good purchase of 43 inch tv at price of mobile."
30,5,Highly recommended,"exelent tv😍😍😍😍😍1:PICTURE QUALITY VERY GOOD JUST LIKE 4K ,2:SOUND JUST AWESOME😍 ,3: PERFORMENCE GOOD ,4:OVERALL VERY GOOD AND VALUE FOR MONEY I M SO HAPPY THANKS ""MI"" AND ""FLIPKART"",4: DELIVERY AND INSTALLATION VERY GOOD."
31,4,Really Nice,I waited for almost 6 months to do a honest review i thought I must use it thoroughly. When I bought this TV back in September 2019 the brightness of the picture was a bit low after using for one month they given us an update called vivid picture engine after that update the picture quality was fantastic and the brightness increased.  Pros 1. Value for money 2. Good picture quality 3. Great connectivity options 4. Easy to use symbol interface 5. Good build quality. 6. Extremely lightweight  Cons 1. Sound output is low even though it's 20 watts speaker 2. Company does not provide Wall mount for free even batteries of the remote control are not provided
32,5,Terrific purchase,First I would like to thank flipkart team for fast and safe delivery....  Coming to the TV Product  Mi Led smart TV 4A pro is very good product worth to buy ....  Picture Quality 10/10 Sound 10/10 Design 10/10  Overall Nice product from Mi.....
33,4,Delightful,"VIDEO: has serious brightness issue... video appears like 8-9 year old technology plasma TV. Does NOT have that brightness of a LED (that too I'm surprised because it is direct LED and not edge). Every Indian film and serials on cable channels look like they have been shot in moist humid wet climate. Also blacks are NOT real deep black.  Now saving grace and positives about video is the color reproduction is natural (sometimes too much natural and dull). And this less brightness maybe less harmful to the eyes.  AUDIO: is pretty good.  OTHER POINTS: -no auto HDMI playback, -no audio playback from mobile to TV over Bluetooth (only Bluetooth audio output from the TV), -both Patchwall(android based) and Android OS are present- so more internal storage used, -usual thick bezels and bezels and stands are black in color, so does not look premium for 2019, -only two out of three usb ports will play files, third one will only support mouse or keyboard, -remote control though cute is minimally functional (for eg.: even mute button is not there). -have to pay ₹500 extra for the wall mount.  Overall verdict: TV is just above average, would have given 3 stars but because of the price giving 4 stars. If interested in this TV, do not have very high expectations and never ever compare it to SONY and LG. Price is competitive and if you looking for such a TV in this price range and you don't mind the brightness issue and like plasma TV like image, then can buy and you won't be disappointed."
34,1,Worst experience ever!,Worst product of Mi . Not satisfied at all with this product . Brightness is very low like local made company led . Don’t go for this add more budget in this and go for brands like sony and LG .. led panel of the this Led is worst. Bad experience with mi and Flipkart both . Flipkart shouldn’t sell these kind of worst product 😡😡. Mi balo pese barbad ho gye tmhare product pr 😡
35,1,Not 100% Smart TV from Flipkart,"It's not recommended to any one as lot of specification game from Flipkart as well as MI. Lot of online streaming channels not support to this TV. Better you go with other brand which support any online web streaming platform. TRUST, this will not meet your expectation, if you genuinely looking for smart TV."
36,5,Great product,"I have been using mi product for some time now. This might be 10th device I brought from mi and 3rd TV.  I brought 49th inch 2 years back which is working good. Also ordered 32 inch 6month back which work as charm. I ordered this new one to install in my parents room. As expected picture and sound quality is good.  Rs12500 for 32 inch smart TV is best TV in market. It has in-built chrome cast which is best feature in smart TV + it support android OS. Chrome cast make it easy to cast any video from YouTube and video supporting app(hoststar, boot, Sony Liv). Also android OS helped to install added on apps from play store and apks.  Other companies like LG and Samsung doesn't provide in-build chrome cast feature. One might have to buy chrome cast device and attach to TV which add cost up to ~ rs 2000."
37,1,Hated it! This Tv has issues with connecting to Wifi .,"This tv has a big problem with wifi connection.  A typical frustration case:  Mi Tv 4A pro has issue with connecting to wifi( typically 2.4GHz and 5GHz space) . If I connect Mi Tv to Personal hotspot of mobile it works fine. But If i connect to wifi( any wifi ranges from 2.4GHz and 5GHz space -tried with 5 Wifi networks ) its connecting to wifi but shows no internet access. Even after connecting only 3 to 4 minutes internet will work after that it says "" ""Wifi has no internet access"" But connection remains same.  If I do deep clean and then reconnect to wifi the internet will work for 2 to 3 mins after that tv says ""you have connected to wifi that has no internet access""  Example: After connection youtube app works only for two or three minutes later you tube will not work similar with all apps.  Note: The same wifi network will works fine in Mobile/Laptop but not in Mi tv. Also called network engineer to test and ensure no issue with wifi all settings are correct.   so in summary whats the problem??   1. Not connecting to wifi internet- "" Mi tv 4a pro will connect to wifi but it says no internet access""  What i tried to fix it by calling Mi customer care and their advice.  1. Deep cleaned tv via Tv manager app- Not solved my problem 2. Update the android to latest version - Not solved my problem 3. Done factory reset - Not solved my problem 4. Checked Network settings like , DHCP, etc .. selected DHCP everting is fine - but not solved my problem."
38,4,Very Good,amazing picture quality. it gives u a crystal clear picture view that makes ur experience better than the other led tvs... it has also many features like hotstar google assistant screencast and others... for me it is the best led tv in market in best price...
39,5,Worth every penny,Awesome Tv great quality nice tv picture quality best sound quality perfect and connectivity good Total good Tv is best
40,5,Great product,"This the best SmartTV for this price,The picture quality is awesome,it's like 4K and the sound quality is good.Netflix,prime video are not supported at first but after an update they are running.The Bluetooth remote is very good and very easy to operate and it has Google Assistant and Spotify app..... overall it's the best TV👌 you could buy."
41,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"Pros: 1. Very Good Picture quality with nice sound system. 2. A nice TV with Android & Chromecast facility in Low Cost. 3. Wifi functionality is perfect. 4. Google voice search works fine. 5. Chormecast working fine.  Cons: 1.I can't find any pre-loaded browser by DEFAULT.OR in play store.   If these defects are rectified in future through updation, this tv would be the best low cost tv available in Indian Market."
42,5,Great product,"After lots of research and reading hundreds of reviews brought this tv with mixed feelings. Here is my honest review after watching for 3 days - NO BRIGHTNESS ISSUE - picture is so clear n bright even at 50% backlight n brightness...100% is not required at all. Brilliant resolution. Sound Connectivity everything is perfect. Just go for it without second thought. And for ppl who compare it with VU, let me tell u dat MI already has strong presence in terms of service centers...dey will cater to tv and mobile repair in dese centers, dey hv good customer care, and MI is trending in india dese dys so no worry abt support."
43,3,Nice,only point is picture brightness is low. i bought 2 mi led smart tv 1 is 43 and 2nd is 40 and there is differences in picture quality i am using from 3 months i suggest 40 inch tv is far better than 43 inch go for 40 inch tv without any doubt which is best in all parameter and less in price and 40 inch is latest. all is good in this tv.
44,1,Worst Installlation Service provided,"I wish to know if all those who buy this TV from Flipkart, how good and quick installation service was available from the supporting technical team after delivery? The product was delivered on 8th feb and I was informed about installation on 9th feb. Surprisingly, i never got any information and just waited till evening. then I wrote to them and have been a chain mail of sorry and taking actions since then. I wonder, because even after raising the issue since 7-8 days for 1 whole week, Flipkart customer care calls to check whether the installation was done, service provider asks the same question, 'when they can come' and take a time, make you wit at home and never come, call or inform. Again the same routine next day, flipkart office calls to know, then to apologize, then to ask for the last 24 hrs and again note being able to solve it. This is really the routine I have lived with this whole week. I had also paid for 2 years extended warranty, but now, it seems that money might be going to flipkart for free because they have no control on providing a professional service of a simple installation, how would they ever provide warranty related service. If they ever need to sustain in large appliance sale, they need professional service partners, nor unprofessional morons who break their own promise not one but multiple times to make the customer suffer. I have a sincere suggestion to all those fellow customers buying r planning to buy big appliances, be very careful about the service response promptness available in your area as I am not staying in a remote location, I am staying in a metro set-up, capital of a large state. To make it feel worst, i am also the plus member and a very old customer, may be 8-9 years. Please be careful"
45,5,Perfect product!,"First of all it's not a 100cm(40inch) TV, It's about 90cm(35.5inch), but a Value for money Android TV. Awesome High Definition Picture Quality, Clear & Smooth Audio. I'm using only with Broadband Connection, without CABLE & SET TOP BOX. But only 4.7GB of 8GB RAM is available, but this is not a big issue.  Now come to the Delivery & Installation process: Flipkart delivered my TV within 2days of order placing, & next day installation. Thanks to Mi & Flipkart for such a great product & service."
46,5,Highly recommended,"A good product with number of functionality like as Chromecast in built, android os, patchwall os, Bluetooth remote controller, voice commands using remote, various ports, decent resolution in term of price and a great deal. Thank you!"
47,5,Awesome,"This time MI person done excellent job, he improve brightness issue which was earlier in mi led TV... Over all this TV is worth for money... Brightness quality is good, sound 🔊 good... Awesome TV. Must go for it...."
48,1,Absolute rubbish!,"you are buying full HD tv, but pathwall is designed to operate as half HD only, screen resolution is full HD, but processor is not fast enough, so MI designed pathwall to operate at half HD. if you want to watch dth, then half HD fullfill ur criteria as no dth provider provide resolution of full hd, but if u want to use apps like netflix, prime, hotstar, max u will be getting half hd, if u attach firestick and try to watch full HD, then processor wont support and display will not be smooth. All existing customers can try it once, run any movie which provide fast moving arial view. u will observe some discontinuity in motion. so screen is full HD but you wont be able to watch Full HD in any possible case"
49,5,Must buy!,Tv quality is superv.....at this price u cant get anything better than this it was delivered in 2 days.......i am so happy n thank u Flipkart for such an awesome product.....
50,4,Value for money,"TV is excellent at Rs 16500 Delivery and installation is Quick. But only thing when engineer is come to installation he is try to sell stabilizer , USB cable and other accessories. and he is taking RS 100 extra. but Flipkart is return this amount after many followups. picture quality is nice Sound is unto the mark. look is nice and build quality also good. Google assistant feature in the remote is very useful.  Screen mirroring is not working"
51,4,Value-for-money,"good picture quality, and great sound.. but brightness level is low. cast from mobile some times its disconnected with in 5 mins..other wise great choice in ths budget...."
52,4,Pretty good,nice product mi led smart TV 4a pro 80 cm.. packing is good and product save
53,5,Super!,awesome I'm receiving tv today the installation is in the super fast in the evening ....I'm very happy
54,5,Wonderful,Worth to buy really good product packaging is good and installation also next day of delivery if you call to service call centres nice product
55,4,Nice product,Nice sound effects and image clarity very nice mi tv 4a pro worth for money
56,5,Simply awesome,Awesome TV from price point of view. Ofcourse quality will be tested in next 1-2 years. Big branded TV work for minimum 10 years without issue but MI tv if work for 5 years it will be good. Took risk to buy it as today technology change fast and we don’t want costly TV which run for more years but we need Cheaper TV which run for atleast 5 yrs.
57,3,Just okay,Screen mirror is not here 🙁 picture brightness is not good 😥 sound is good🙂 I think Vu picture quality is better but not sound quality . Sound quality of Mi is better. I request to Mi managments plz try to start screen mirror in this tv. here is only google screen cost which is so bad connection. that is why I am giving only 3 star. I am not happy with this tv. 😒
58,5,Great product,"very good product in this price, it's connectivity is too good and i like Data saving mode helps to save 3times of internet usage i observed it, but i am not able to ise screen mirror feature in it."
59,5,Great product,MI LED Smart TV 4A PRO super TV pictures Quality awesome low price TV India ( xiaomi thanks you)
60,5,Great product,Go with this TV guys it's amazing.. 43 inch at 20k mi.. Awesome del by flipkart and installation guy was also very nice and explained well
61,1,Don't waste your money,"as they mentioned it is not a smart tv . it doesnt support prime,netflix,hotstar VU tv is better than this dont buy this tv. worst flipkart support, actually i am a big worst tvfan of flipkart . i have 600+ coins in flipkart .. but from now i dont support flipkart flatform"
62,1,Very poor,"I feel not to buy this smart TV as this wil not work on WiFi. after several update, restatry, coordination with call center, unable work on WiFi mode especially in YouTube & prime video. only work on Ethernet cable. in WiFi TV hangs & need to restart both TV & router. through Ethernet cable video quality is good."
63,1,Terrible product,Please dont buy TV will not work more than 1 year.. I purchased TV in August 2020 but I may 2021 TV is not working. I buy that protection plan also for 3 years complained there but still no one come to check this is july month now. For that flipkart also not helping giving only dates dates & dates...... All are liers....
64,2,Expected a better product,"Good TV, but mirror casting is not possible without internet connectivity. Also, most videos doesn't support audio if we run pendrive.Then how can MI claim this TV as a smart one"
65,5,Mind-blowing purchase,very good product low price running smooth satisfied this product thank you...
66,4,Delightful,"After buying this for 21500 i saw reviews on youtube about it an came across video where they said installation time was huge after getting the T.V also you cant open it as it voids warranty, which made me think twice on the purchase made, but Flipkart lived up to the expectation the TV was delivered in morning and installed by afternoon same day 👍🙂  Cons: TV doesn't have Amazon Prime video or Netflix's or Jio cinema ( possibly you can side load them not tried that yet) Brightness is weired, even with dynamic brightness off Cable TV looks darker(could be cause i am using AV input) Wifi reception is not strong enough Absence of mute button on factory remote"
67,4,Very Good,over all best in budget segments.picture quality good suppoy 4k videos. sound nice. mobile connection need same WiFi band or another phone hotspot.. over all nice
68,4,Worth the money,The tv is good but the installation is not good.. Jeeves will not respond and they will reschedule the installation date for next day daily... And they will come on our convenient day. If you book the mi tv then you can able to contact the mi for installation of your TV they will respond within 6 hours.
69,4,Pretty good,"Value for money. Picture- I played some videos from YouTube, picture quality is good. Still need to check for dth as I don't have hd set top box. Sound- Speakers are really impressive. Connectivity- Enough options available so no issue with that, I tried chromecast, hdmi, 3.5mm jack and all is working fine. Only issue is that after wall mounting avi ports are almost impossible to reach, hdmi ports are still ok to reach. Delivery and installation- Delivered in 2 days so happy with the Flipkart delivery. Installation took 3 days and also the service provided by jeeves was not good. I had to call the technician number of times and also when he arrived he was in a hurry and didn't explain all the functionality. To summarise my review, overall it is a value for money product."
70,5,Terrific,Mi smart tv is best... Worth of money💯💵... Thank you flipkart ❤️❤️❤️😁💯... Good installation
71,4,Wonderful,"Good product. but would like to share some negative things as under. 1. crime cast not function properly. 2. sometimes AV not connects. 3. sound quality is normal therefore sound bar or home theatre is must required. 4. The TV is android but application installed from unknown source not working properly i.e Google Chrome, What's App, Netflix, Amazon prime, etc. 5.wall Mount may be included in TV box, because installation process be lated due to non availability of it. Positive points 1. Bluetooth feature is Amazing. you can enjoy everything without disturbing anyone though Bluetooth headphones. 2. Voice search is amazing which reduces your time to find anything rather than type. 3. picture quality is very good."
72,1,Horrible,"Good products this price range, amazing performance Sounds to good Picture quality best Remote so unique All over best TV One problem TV on like everytime android logo bootup After 8 months TV automatically turn off not turn on , very bad experience"
73,5,Classy product,TV is so good performance. easy mobile mirroring. sound quality good. Google assistance good work. i like Mi 4A pro Smart TV MaHeSh
74,4,Good choice,A good TV for which actually I was looking for. A better HDR quality with 20 watts speakers gives a awesome touch for a 32 inch TV also for those who are having small rooms. Overall experience is good till now and actually fullfilled my all expectations. One of the major advantage is having and Android Platfrom which provides you multiple of applications supported for this TV. Must recommended TV if you buy it with 3 years full protection plan whereas also the installation and demo was provided with the proper guidelines by assigned engineer for free of cost.
75,5,Wonderful,Great value for money. Unbeatable product at the given price range. So far the experience has been great. - Picture quality is good. There are not many options to play around with brightness and contrast though.  - The connectivity options and the android tv features are very good. Mine shipped with Android 9. Only average thing in it it is the sound quality.  - Overall a fab product for the price.
76,4,Very Good,"I ordered this mi TV 4A pro on January 2020 . My point of view about this mi TV is really good , worth for money , sound quality good . This TV is provided with Android os which is user friendly ."
77,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"Very Nice TV.  HD channels are too good to see. SD channels also looks better than other TVs. Sound is also good. it has inbuilt WiFi connectivity. overall , I am satisfied customer. it's better than LG 32 inches TV in this price range, clarity wise ."
78,4,Value-for-money,"this is my first ever Smart TV or led TV. for long time I am using old age TV. I am thinking of buying a smart TV. I have checkout different brands, compared price. then after checking all out I decided to buy Mi 4a pro 43 inch smart TV. it's picture quality is good, sound quality is awesome you don't have to get extra speakers. I bought this during Diwali big billion days sale at a price of 19249. I am very happy with it. thanks flipkart for it"
79,4,Value-for-money,The review I'm giving here after 1 month full usage. good quality picture but not even too good but it also supports 4k video.
80,5,Must buy!,"if you are viewing tv get HD channels & you have amazing picture quality , good sound, good connectivity, lots of features. Loved the patch wall. Frankly I don't think you can hope for more at this price. VFM"
81,5,Worth every penny,MI TV is good and picture quality is best and connectivity is very nice thank you for MI and Flipkart☺️
82,4,Good quality product,"Great product if you are willing to eliminate the set top box headache altogether and divert that money towards streaming services like hotstar, sony liv etc. Not all movies / shows are playable free of cost, you have to cast them using your phone (if you have jo /airtel sim some services are free in hotstar). Jiotv and airteltv are not streamable however. Had issues with sound quality. Suddenly increases or decreases, which you need to setup manually to see which is the best. Also internet connectivity using ethernet or wifi suddenly disconnects."
83,5,Awesome,"Hi All, This product is worth the money. 43' 4A PRO from Mi - Good buy and value for money. Looking forward for Android update to use apps like SunNxt. Sound is awesome. YouTube plays effortlessly. Smart Remote control Bluetooth pairing was good, no issues and this remote has got Google Voice assistant, works really well. In summary, Its a nice product from Mi in 2019. Awesome Delivery by Flipkart with well scheduled delivery on time and same day installation and demo too."
84,5,Perfect product!,Thank you flipkart for the awesome product. MI tv is also Appreciable for all things are perfect a) tv b) delivery c) installation d) use. i will give 5/5 in everything but the connectivity is lill bit slow. but over all i must say its a best tv in the budget go for it guys. you will surely love it.
85,5,Fabulous!,Super picture quality and sound quality👌👌 I am happy with mi tv good quality and good design also and the behaviour of installation man is very good
86,5,Simply awesome,"Being a smart TV, this is basically an Android device with a large screen and a remote for controlling. One can perform any action on this TV that one could do on an Android device, except calling, of course. This TV has all the features of a conventional TV set and much more. The TV can be connected to the internet via Wi-Fi or an Ethernet cable to access and view anything on the web. There are 3 HDMI ports that can be used to connect a computer and then this devics acts as a large computer monitor. Two USB ports that comes with it ensures that media can be played from USB storage devices. There is the option to connect conventional RCA cables and a coaxial cable. About 4.7 GB of internal storage space is available in the device that can be used to store files as in a regular Android device. The display quality (HD) is good for a device of this price range and this display size. The remote control that comes with it is a smart remote control that has inbuilt Bluetooth connectivity and acts as a conventional remote plus a microphone for giving audio inputs to the TV. There is an option to play screen savers on the screen when it is idle, which is cool. The speakers are of good quality. It can surely satisfy the TV needs of a typical Indian household."
87,5,Worth every penny,This tv is really value for money. Resolution is really good sound quality is fine ..just when you make it full volume sound quality decays a little. Connectivity is also good. User interface is really interesting and easy for aged persons to use

89,5,Mind-blowing purchase,Superb TV by Mi !. Writing this review after 6 months of getting it. Android and PatchWall both are having good UI. I recommend everyone to buy this TV who are looking for buying one at a very less cost. Please like it if you understand my views.
90,5,Super!,very good tv . pictures quality very good .sound quality very good. also very good i am happy
91,5,Worth every penny,It's just a LED TV but smart. Your can't expect high definition picture quality. It's a decent TV with good sound quality. Picture could have been improved. You need to buy stabilizer separately.
92,5,Worth every penny,"Pros: 1. Good picture clarity. 2. Starting and app loading loading is ok. 3. usable memory of about 1.5 GB free space. 2.5 is taken by Android. Cons: 1. Remote sometimes doesn't take from angles,1 has to stand straight/in Line with TV. 2. Sound quality is pathetic, doesn't suit HD videos, one will need Home theatre."
93,3,Good,Nice TV if you are on a tight budget but dont expect picture quality like high end or even mid range SONY. tv's .  internet connectivity is good you can enjoy YouTube but Netflix and prime video doesn't work as if now . so you have to keep this thing in mind.
94,4,Very Good,"Reviewing after 20 days of usage  HD- Ready display , so don't expect magnificent but not bad . Sound could have been better (If possible buy a Mi soundbar also ) . Hotstar , Prime video , Netflix , SonyLiv all works great and picture quality of their HD content is good . Use HD channels in your set top box . Connectivity has no issues . Chromecast works great . Stabilizer optional .  Delivery was timely so was the installation ."

99,4,Very Good,awesome tv. tried watching 4k but it only supports 1080p. Also during installation the guy told me that wall mounting would cost extra 500/- which was fine but i suggested I'll wait for few days see if the tv looks good on stand or wall mount is better. He said if you call me after 2 days the cost of wall mount will be 800 which felt wrong to me because it's the same wall mount. The amount of work is same too
100,5,Simply awesome,Nice TV. Only HD channels are full clarity but SD channels are not clarity. Everything is good. OK It can be bought. Sound clarity very nice..
101,5,Just wow!,good price and very nice quick delivery and demo and installed good picture quality nice good sound i am happy
102,4,Good choice,"Am purchased in 2019 and writing after 10 months. It's valued for each rupees. Enjoyed much. I still thank MI for beautiful design to reach for all. And even Flipkart. All features are working very fine, I installed allmost all apps and internet and Google assistant is awesome.  Cast will work fine but before you cash/mobile sharing data should be connected to TV and also in mobile.  Overall am all given features are valued for money as this is lowest priced Android TV in market. Recommended to buy instead wasting in other brands ......"
103,4,Good choice,"Picture Quality is good. Sound is loud enough but not theater like or dolby digital sound like. The tv has wifi connectivity is issue that is really irritating so we got a wifi extender and pluged it just near the tv and now the tv is able to stream 4k videos with any problem. It has system update available which will provide official support for Netflix and Prime videos and will upgrade the os to android pie, so update it as soon as possible. The engineering who came from jeevas for wall mount installation was quite naive and caused a lot of headache. But if we talk about the experience with it is quite great and value of money. Just get a stronger router or an extender if wifi connectivity issue occurs."

105,5,Perfect product!,"A good all rounder. I had used Vu TV in past but faced a panel issue thank god since I had Jevees extended warranty got my money back, so this time thinking to buy a branded TV like LG or Sony but also interested in Android so gave a chance to MI keeping money in mind. Writing this review just after 5 mins of installation it's an amazing TV guys even SD channel clarity far better than Vu and no extra speakers required. Don't think much just go for it.."

108,1,Don't waste your money,very worst product it's smart tv but jugad tv lot of connectivity but nothing works smooth n perfect it's just basic tv which have chromecast which just allows u to cast only through Google products it's pure google product don't buy if u want smart tv
109,5,Wonderful,Great value for money. Unbeatable product at the given price range. So far the experience has been great. - Picture quality is good.

122,4,Delightful,"Awesome product, sound, picture, clarity everything is great..such a nice product. Value for money, strongly recommended for purchase."
123,5,Highly recommended,"tv picture quality is very goog cum dam me best tv i love it Screen mirroring possible In the app"""" Wi-Fi display header"""" I try and better work"
124,5,Just wow!,Tv is good quality must be demo is not comfortable in products I will taking in demo men I have u products mount in demo men coming in hand plz request me. Delivery Is person is not handing this product plz request me u r product is delivery person is correct u handing
125,1,Worst experience ever!,they sould work on connectivity .. picture quality is good in this price not that great but good. Its a good package in android smart tv. I can say that with patchwall in it giving edge to this mi 4a pro in this price range against all its contemporaries.
126,5,Super!,"1. Picture quality is Good. Better than expected. 2. Sound quality is good. 3. You cannot use it as 2nd Monitor. It does not support. 4. You can cast your mobile screen. It works perfect. 5. Connectivity has some lag. 6. Netflix is not supported. 7. You cannot install Video Streaming apps. It has inbuilt apps like Zee5, Hotstar etc useless apps. 8. Overall 3/5 Better than other products at this price point."
127,4,Value-for-money,"Like all Reviewers said, Mi smart TV 4A pro is a value for money product. At this price range it is the best one available in market but it has cons too. Doesn't play the sound properly with my philips home theatre. (Fyi: The home theatre plays well with laptop and mobile phone but both only one speaker works when connected to smart TV.) Some software bug is there which needs to be rectified by Xiaomi. Also doesn't mirror cast with my mobile phone (Note 5 pro)"
128,2,Could be way better,1. you can not install all Google Apps. it is limited access. 2. sound quality not satisfactory. 3. you can not connect your mobile directly via USB port. only pendrive or card reader and hard drive supported. 4. some applications can not support smart remote like Sony live. 5. Dual audio file not supported by inbuilt media player. you need to install other player. 6. need some media player options in smart remote like next and previous.
129,5,Wonderful,Mi 4A PRO 80 cm (32 inch )HD Ready LED Smart Android TV is awesome. I write this after 15 months regular use.
130,3,Fair,Budget TV... Picture quality is average... Sound is good at this price - dtsHD.... Android works good but Mirroring phone is quite difficult.... Also Quality of that Bluetooth remote is good in connectivity but seems ok ok .... Wise advice - If you have more rs.10000 then you should go for 43 inch. ie FULL HD so picture quality will be great in comparison to 32 inch. Overall this is VALUE FOR MONEY and I bought it at 11499 only with 10% instant discount available on SBI debit cards (1000rs.)
131,4,Good choice,Product is Good. Earlier i used 32inch Mi 4A and could see lots of difference from that. Display is bright and clear. Audio wise the sound is clear but the maximum sound itself is not that loud. You need to keep more than 50% to use for normal usage. Connectivity wise there are few issues some times while switching between apps. Screen become slow to response and lots of apps not available in playstore which requires in smart TV.But connecting to Prime and Netflix is fast and internet connectivity is good. Worth for the buck in this price range.
132,5,Excellent,"One of the best TV you will get in this price. Excellent picture quality and sound. Best connectivity. Good service from both flipkart and jeeves, as they installed it before the scheduled time."
133,3,Fair,"Rating: 3.5/5  Pros 1. High value for money. You absolutely cannot get this screen size, image quality, Android TV and Netflix+ Prime in built from any other brand. 2. Android TV is great, the app options are good and increasing.  Cons 1. If you connect Bluetooth speakers, Netflix would run with distorted audio and Prime would show an error whenever you try to play any content. 2. Audio is quite inconsistent and I find myself maxing out the volume because the treble is really low sometimes, without adding any bass. 3. The processor is pretty slow, which means around a full minute for the Home screen to load. 4. Pretty small detail but they should mention in the description that batteries are not provided with the remote. Not everyone would have a couple of AAA size ones lying around. Although I understand that is a safety measure to prevent any heat related explosion during transport. 5. Android TV App, while makes life easier by replacing the TV remote, cannot start/turn off the TV. And the biggest advantage i.e. a touch keyboard, doesn't work with Youtube/Netflix/Prime."
134,4,Delightful,"best TV in the budget! Everything is very nice except delivery, the delay in delivery more than a week! Jeeves is so quick they try their best to install your TV as soon as possible! overall very satisfied with the TV! but there is a problem in connectivity. chrome cast doesn't works"
135,5,Wonderful,I bought MI LED smart tv 2week ago its working good but picture HD quality is ok what I expected good sound and look smart TV had 3* rating
136,5,Perfect product!,"hello there, i am sunny from chhattisgarh and i ordered this tv on big billion days and i got it on 9th oct and installation on 10th oct. delivery is i think late but installation is very nice very fast. Now About this Smart Tv,,,,,, it is Awesome i mean really Awesome... i am very happy to have this tv.. Don't think too much to buy or not just go for it"
137,4,Pretty good,"I purchased on 21 July 2019. Reviewing after 1 weak use.  Pros: 1. Picture quality is not so good however best in this price range. For picture quality setting, vivid is much better than standard. 2. Sound quality is great. 3. Google assistance is great. Voice Search is good. 4. Patchwall like YouTube home page is good and provide easy access of content. 5. You can access Gmail and Facebook. 6. Inbilt Google Play Store.  Cons: 1. Takes time to start first time. However switching time depends on internet speed. 2. Some times become hange during switching wifi connection. 3. Gamepad is additional requirement for playing game.  Overall value for money."
138,4,Value-for-money,The review I'm giving here after 1 month full usage. good quality picture but not even too good but it also supports 4k video.
139,4,Good quality product,"picture and sound quality are very nice, this tv is best performance with internet connection as well as Hotstar, youtube etc. overall the MI 4A pro is very good performance in this range."
140,5,Perfect product!,I bought this tv 10days ago and now I m writing this review. Pros: 1. Great sound quality 2. Nice picture quality with great viewing angles. 3. Built-in Chromecast works perfectly. 4. Great service by Flipkart got the installation on the same day of installation. Cons: 1. I have to purchase the wall mount separately because it does not comes out of the box. 2. Otherwise no issues at all. Conclusion: Great TV at this price point and u also get that much features and all.
141,5,Brilliant,"Perfect for 23K price range...!!! Awesome Movie experience with my Sony Dolby hometheatre.. Sound and picture quality is awesome with USB mode rather than DTH or cable connection... Only Cons is, While we connect our smartphone through usb Image and Video loading takes up too much time... 100% it is worth buying.."
142,5,Great product,Mi the best led tv ever best picture quality sound also very good in this range best quality 5star tv
143,5,Best in the market!,Perfect picture quality nice sound. Complete TV in this budget. Delivery n Installation on time given by flipkart. Behaviour of installation boy is good but cost of other assesories is very high demanded by installation boy. Thank you Flipkart. Value for money
144,5,Wonderful,"Worth the price not that much nice in look but okkk in this price range.. Installation was super fast , I got it installed within a hour after delivery & the installation engineer was actually of nice behavior... Overall a happy & satisfied experience with MI..."
145,5,Awesome,"1. Superb picture quality. 2. Superb sound quality, although online media like Youtube sounds better than my HD SETTOP box. 3. Easy and Hazzle free connectivity. 4. Takes onlyaround 15 sec to bootup with only built in apps. 5. Could easily install apps using apk files. 6. USB plug n play working fine. 7. Light weight and easy installation. 8. Overall true value for money."
146,4,Very Good,it's just awesome everything inbuilt u just need the Wi-Fi connection for enjoying the entertaining world.  it's good on this cost. there is no screen mirroring . all we have to connect mobile through chrome cast.
147,5,Great product,"Very good product. Service guy came and install TV before schedule time(A big thumbs up). HD ready TV but got very good clarity. I have connect it with wifi,it works fine. Sound quality very good. Missing mobile cast screen option(may be available could not find it till now). I am happy with this product."
148,5,Highly recommended,Using it for last one week.Here is my thoughts:  1.Picture quality is very good for HD content.Average for SD.If you're miracast your device just use 1080p content.You gonna really love it. 2.Connectivity is good if you use Android OS rather than PatchWall. 3.Sound: Volume can go very loud but lacks crispness.Still it is better in this price range. 4.Ease of use. 5.PatchWall content are free for 3 months or so.  *Installation: Worst thing about this purchase was installation.They never came for the demo.I had to call local Engineer to wall mount the TV on my own which cost me extra 500(excluding Wall Stand).
149,1,Not recommended at all,It proves that less cost means low quality...tv is overall ok..but lots connectivity issue...does not stay connected more than 5 min..every time you have to connect with wifi... You tube and other apps are also very slow..even i have to restart so many times...but my previouse tv was good enough... They are now started selling garbage now...dont buy... casting is not working yet... Moreover it is a normal tv..not smart tv...topi pehna dia mi ne...
150,5,Perfect product!,"it's a good TV at best price nowadays, definitely it's a 4k TV ,no doubt of can't playing 4k videos,you can see the 4k options in images I posted, and the picture quality is mind blowing,but it has issues like can't play some video formats(no sound )but it's not a big issue,and brightness of TV is slightly dim but its ok, don't compare it with the LG,sony, Samsung TV's, at this price it's a best TV u can buy, if you are looking for a perfect TV at best price just just go for it I bought it for 23k.overall it's a fantastic TV."
151,1,Worst display quality.... ever seen ...,I don't know. How this TV got this many number of buyers. the quality of display is worst. Not even 'below average'. Horrible. Since I have exchanged my old LED tv with this. I don't have the option to exchange with any other brand. My old LED tv has very good display compared to this.
152,4,Nice product,"I recieved it 5 days back and using since then. Really very nice TV in this budget. Picture quality very good even with wide angles as sides n corners, sound is sufficient enough for 10*20 feet room. Connectivity is also good. I am satisfied with the product."
153,4,Delightful,Mi 32inch led tv valuable product that price sound quality awesome display quality good that price I brought 11500 rs with icici card it lovely tv that budget u can also try it
154,5,Highly recommended,Its amazing at this price. It have NetflixApp and Amazonprime app buttons in remote itself. Almost all android tv apps supported and is super fast. Great value for money.
155,5,Simply awesome,"The product is overall good. But mirror cast do not work due to pie update from MI. However casting supported apps like YOUTUBE, MX PLAYER,Google photos works efficiently with no problem. Thumbs up for that. Also the DATA saver mode is very good, consumes very less amount of data and streams video in 480p- 720p. Approx 300 mb of data is consumed on watching 1 hr of Youtube through mirror cast at 480p. I am satisfied."
156,5,Best in the market!,wonderful product picture quality is so nice sound also good delivery on time installation is Jeeves is very bad mi TV is soooooo good I like it
157,5,Worth every penny,"Amazing TV... First time bought a smart TV and its worth buying. So much happy with it, about sound, picture, accessibility speed and look. And most shocking thing is that its weight which is so light and friendly use😊. But engineer takes so much time on installation approx 9-10 days. I think in future flipkart will provide good service on time as much as they can."

163,4,Delightful,Mi 32inch led tv valuable product that price sound quality awesome display quality good that price I brought 11500 rs with icici card it lovely tv that budget u can also try it
164,5,Highly recommended,Its amazing at this price. It have NetflixApp and Amazonprime app buttons in remote itself. Almost all android tv apps supported and is super fast. Great value for money.
165,5,Simply awesome,"The product is overall good. But mirror cast do not work due to pie update from MI. However casting supported apps like YOUTUBE, MX PLAYER,Google photos works efficiently with no problem. Thumbs up for that. Also the DATA saver mode is very good, consumes very less amount of data and streams video in 480p- 720p. Approx 300 mb of data is consumed on watching 1 hr of Youtube through mirror cast at 480p. I am satisfied."
166,5,Best in the market!,wonderful product picture quality is so nice sound also good delivery on time installation is Jeeves is very bad mi TV is soooooo good I like it
167,5,Worth every penny,"Amazing TV... First time bought a smart TV and its worth buying. So much happy with it, about sound, picture, accessibility speed and look. And most shocking thing is that its weight which is so light and friendly use😊. But engineer takes so much time on installation approx 9-10 days. I think in future flipkart will provide good service on time as much as they can."
168,5,Must buy!,EXCELLENT 👌 Super I like this TV.very nice product at this price range.Good picture & sound quality.screen screen mirring not working.simply awesome.Thank you flipkart.
169,5,Must buy!,"Well it's been 12 days after receiving this tv i am writing my review, Firstly thanks to flipkart to deliver this product in time, now coming to tv MI 4A PRO 43' i was so high exited when this tv comes to my home this tv is amazing , mind blowing, great picture quality, wifi,bluetooth works perfectly. Only issue is with sound quality but it can be adjustable in setting, some how you will satisfied with sound. and lastly i had a problem with playing movie through pendrive."
170,4,Delightful,"Tv is Value for money it's HD only not 4K, picture quality is below average. Sound Quality is average. Rest is awesome like connectivity, user interface, The remote is very cute. it's come with 4 star rating. installation is smooth but delivery is very problematic. the delivery partner was very bad."
171,5,Terrific,Hello all..  I had ordered earlier 43 inches MI tV and for now ordered 32 for my room since m married and would like to have one in bed room too.. Installation was done very next day after the TV delivered.. Mr Ratan Kumar installed it rapid fast and also an expert for sure.. I would like to appreciate him so much that he himself place the call to ensure the availability at home.. Same guy installed my 43inches TV also.. many thanks to team who ever was in the picture in delivering and installing the TV at home. Many thanks to almighty for fulfilling my desire :) Lastly Thanks to you for sparing your time and reading the comment :)
172,5,Excellent,"I'll be honest with y'all i was a bit worried as i have never ordered such a huge home appliance before  so here's how my experience was first of all kudos to flipkart delivery they delivered it on time & the product was alright and without any kind of damage  Now let's get started with the product itself  First of all its display clarity is crisp clear i played 4k video on it and it plays it without any lags and problem, the ui is smooth af & the best part about this TV is the sound quality the dolby sound just outshines everything, the sound has amazing bass, you can hear it even on standard set top box channels  Overall it was an amazing & exciting experience i would recommend Mi Tv 4a pro to everyone 🤟its the best you can get at this price range"
173,4,Good choice,"its been around fifty days gone, its feel good to see android on mi televisions, i have a two mi led smart tv's, but android is far better than smart leds in picture clarity and connectivity and its run on 8mbps broadband connection very easily, but there s a problem sometimes in this, the tv is automatically restart sometimes when watching with screen cast,"
174,5,Simply awesome,"I am using for 3 months.I think this one is a great value for money. Just like a big android phone. All apps are compatible.Just you have to study a bit and watch some youtube videos for installing those apps. Picture is quite good in this range. So is connectivity. After recent update ( Android Pie), Prime videos and Netflix are also available. One negative point I think is the sound, which is not great. Rest all good. Overall I am satisfied with this buy. Installation was smooth by Jeeves. I also bought an extended warranty."
175,5,Simply awesome,Great product good picture quality but missing of spdif port is missing in these new version of tv.. Over all good tv good picture quality.. Value for money
176,5,Highly recommended,Fantastic TV.. Thank you MI Smart tv 4A pro 43 inch..thank you flipkart and jeeves for timely delivery and installation.. Must buy tv from Mi.. Completely in budget and all the features that 50k tv gives you.. Classic product.. Thanks
177,4,Good quality product,This is my first experience with Led smart TV's and I can say that it is one of the best economical brand for which customers are looking for as well as trust able. Got discount of 1750/- with sbi card. Go for it guys.
178,5,Highly recommended,nice TV but not as expected but still get enough for a family of 3 value of money well kind of
179,1,Useless product,Led is working fine but install technician is non skilled. He don't know how to On the power of led tv. He declared that LED tv is faulty. But TV is working ok
180,5,Highly recommended,"I red several negative comments of the TV. I thought I took a risk to buy it. However I am not facing any issues, it’s around a month now. Boots in less than 30 seconds, Connectivity is good. Miracast and other apps works really well. Clear picture Quality, Sound system is basic. Google assistant at times looses connectivity but once you disconnect and reconnect your remote with TV it works fine. So far so good. Hope it continues to work well."
181,5,Terrific,I have been using Mi TV from last 1 year and I am very satisfied with the over all performance of the TV. Recently I purchased another Mi TV 40 inch for my office. Thanks to flipkart for providing best offers and super quick delivery and installation service. Mi TV are the best value for money android TV available at very reasonable prices.
182,3,Fair,"Connectivity issues. Works good if you have stable braodband connection. Picture quality is good, sound is good but u can use any home theater for better experience."
183,2,Could be way better,"Picture quality is not that good. Agree that we can't expect good quality in this much amount but after buying this one I think I have waisted my money. Could have gone for established brands. Just experience this tv before buying it....I missed this trick.....so beware. Spend a bit more , try Lg Samsung or Sony. This one is useless. Rest depends upon you. Happy Viewing 🥳 Those who are saying best picture quality in comments haven't watched anything on lg samsung or Sony. They have the every right to say this. Take my word it's just a below average tv.......in terms of display ....hd content doesn't look like hd... I want to sell it .... interested can contact"
184,3,Just okay,"Being a smart TV, this doesn't solve the sole purpose of enjoying a TV without cable box. As it doesn't support the live TV features provided by one the most popular app ""Hotstar"". I'm able to watch live TV on ky phone and on friend's smart TV but not on this one. Even Sony Liv isn't able to perform after this TV got the update for the so called ""Android"" platform."
185,5,Brilliant,The product entirely is a great package at this price point. The picture quality and the sound output is really very good. Thanks to Flipkart for delivering it on time and providing installation service on time. I am truly impressed by the product. It also has Android 9 Pie update. Thank you !
186,3,Just okay,Its nice TV as it is android but at the same item its working is like a mobile which hang. Sluggish performance of operating system but overall nice as you can see so many things online. It lacks a good browser in tv to do online surfing. Remote is not that nice and sounds a lot on pressing a key. Chromecast doesn't work at all after 1 day of use. Looking at the price you can go for it.
187,5,Must buy!,This mi tv is such a good for.. just awesome... too good.. amazing product... good for all things
188,5,Must buy!,One of the best TV I have ever baught under 12k Picture quality is Awesome love you MI ...
189,3,Good,"Value for money in this price range, I get installation within 2 workibg days which us very good services from flipkart. I have gave overall rating 3 as Mi LED Smart TV does not have full HD, sound quality is average as its does not support DTS and Dolbly digital only detect stereo sound from setup box. Regarding in box accessories Battery n wall mount does not include which cost approx Rs 500 to 800."
190,5,Best in the market!,Very good android tv in this price segment. Love it and also very good service of flipkart.flipkart is one of the most trusted online website.
191,5,Fabulous!,Good quality product. Very prompt & nice service by flipkart. Fast Delivery and installation also on same day. So thanks to flipkart for service.
192,5,Simply awesome,Great TV. Colours are good but back level need to be correct. But at this price point having such Big and smart TV is really an opportunity. Thumb up to MI. Really did a good Job.
193,4,Worth the money,This is good deal in this budget. Picture quality is good. sound in good compared to other brand LEDs but still there is place for improvement. Tried to cast my screen and it connected well but it was getting stuck in between when movie was playing and then disconnected itself. Will use it for few weeks and share further reviews.
194,4,Worth the money,100 cm this led tv budget price tv is good mi brand me like .mi is Chinese company but quality all products like mobile.cctv camera .head set all good product me buy this tv 18000/ 3 yers extra warranty so total 20000/ come more over one stabilizer 1500 extra buy + wall mount stand 500 so total 22000/ come .tv is good tv @this price me buy only 4 days gone tv installation good main thanks to filipkart order given 24 Horus me delivery get same day installation all done
195,5,Classy product,Best smart tv and also pictures quality many more app install and game my use time 3 month more than I give feedback must buy auto wifi connection easy password save and many more YouTube run somth
196,3,Nice,This model has serious connectivity issue. Wifi disconnect a lot and even does try to reconnect automatically. I have Mi 4A as well which is working fine with same wifi. I upgraded my wifi router to dual band but still its harware do not capture another 5g band network. Check and compare the wifi hardware before go with the purchase.
197,5,Perfect product!,"If you are looking for a TV which should have all the features what you desire to have which will ultimately lead to a very beautiful tv experience , should definitely buy this. It has all the latest features and one will love using this. Don't go on brand though MI is also a leading brand in mobiles but yes they are evolving in a very different way in TV manufacturing also. Superb picture quality, clear sound, very smart. Google voice is the most impressive feature added in this so that you can play anything or use google just by saying it. But Flipkart has to improve the delivery and installation procedure as didnt get the wall mount from their 3rd party Jeeves at the commited time and it feels like there is nothing called commitment from Flipkart and Jeeves both."
198,3,Does the job,Display is clear and picture quality is good Remote quality should be improved at all cost. Very poor. While you are connecting to wifi the user experience is pathetic. The flows for connecting to wifi needs lot of improvement. Its a low budget tv with good picture quality. That's what you should expect. Don't but if looking for a good user experience
199,3,Nice,I'm writting this review after using MI tv for 45 days. While screen casting quality of the picture was low as compared to branded TV's like LG. Sound volume also not that much High. Actual picture quality was good you enjoy complete HD feeling and connectvity also good.
200,5,Brilliant,Best product in this price. Amazing picture quality although 720p can't be compared with full hd but still this is amazing. Only booting time expected to be improved. Otherwise this product is amazing and the best in this price. Fully satisfied.. ❤️😍🤑
201,5,Brilliant,For this price the Mi 4A Pro led tv was perfect. It was a better option for than the Realme TV as it has AV inputs which I needed. Very easy to use interface and simple uncomplicated remote.
202,5,Super!,I purchased this TV for my relative for gifting purpose..And now whenever I visit there they told me that a good tv I gifted them.. Thanx for MI and flipkart for arranging such a good specification TV at such a good price .
203,5,Highly recommended,Very good so nice exyllent smart Android Led tv
204,4,Value-for-money,Delivery and installation done on same day.. awesome work bye Flipkart and zeeves.. good job.. Best tv in this price... Satisfied purchase
205,5,Wonderful,Awesome smart tv . all function okay. but one thing is that they don't give us wall mount set(they charged us extra 500rs for wall mount). and demo n installation of tv did very late after 7-8 days of delivery.thanks to flipkart for fast delivery
206,5,Terrific,great deal for 43inch tv... must buy everyone great sound great picture great features... only you need good internet and good set top box
207,5,Classy product,"A complete product by Mi. Smooth functioning. All the specifications as described are working to its full esteem. In this price range, its best buy. Delivery and installation in time. Overall very good experience. If you do not have choice for any specific brand, go for this product. If you have any specific brand in your mind, please compare the performance then go for your buy. Being busy, the installation chap could not provide thorough demo. But, I came to know the operation myself. Remote is fantastic with few buttons. Sound output is enough for my 26 ft x 14 ft hall. No additional soundbar is required. Viewing monitor from an extreme angle < 170 degrees gives a good feel. If you view the monitor from a distance of 6ft +, you will get to see the colours at full sharpness. I am a normal user without much tech background. I do not find any abnormality in my experience. When I compare, what I could have got by purchasing leading and costly brands, I feel more than satisfied with my decision to go for Mi 4A."
208,5,Excellent,"Good product. I'm Using 10 day than after putting my Review. picture Quality Best . All videos format support 4k & full hd & hd video Quality Best Results. Sd channel Results ok ok. sound Quality Not satisfied, If you can sound higher Tv Speaker is Torn. Connectivity Bluetooth is You can Easily Connect wireless Speaker , headphone . Wifi Good working . but Chromecast not working properly. Three times tried update tv.but still doesn't Updated. price point of view Good Tv."
209,5,Terrific purchase,I'm very impressed with the service provided by MI and Flipkart. it is a Paisa vasool product for me. I really like the features of the product . it's a yes for me if you want to buy a middle range good product. go for it.

221,5,Terrific,supperb tv in this price all criteria is supperb I use 1 month after review is this price awesome smart tv . connectivity is very easy .youtube work superb and mobile connectivity is awesome overall good product . in this price thank you mi tv.
222,1,Very poor,The only thing I would like to say about the product is it's a smart TV with no smart features. Connectivity is really pathetic. Basic LED TV is far better than this so called smart TV. Complete waste of money
223,5,Super!,This is a best product best sound best picture and best android tv i am very impress for this product this is a very good product for value for money.
224,5,Simply awesome,Good Product at the given price. Need a good speed wifi connection to play contents. Video quality is normal. Audio quality is better than other TVs. Chrome cast works only with Android phones. I was unable to connect iPhone to Chrome cast. You can watch Prime video and Netflix through your android device once you cast them through chrome cast(was able to cast both these apps’ content via Moto G5s plus). Has headphone jack(you can connect your speakers). Bluetooth audio lags when connected to sound bar(I have Philips)
225,5,Wonderful,very good product for this price... don't compare the product with LG and samsung y because with in this cost the given spec is worth...sound is good that is more attractive than other things....I am not satisfied with play store facility ...gmail linkedin that kind of apps are not available in play store ....  for this cost the product is good
226,5,Terrific,Good product and wrothable price of Mi TV I was buying in 16499/- in offer price  1. Thanks to flipkart delivery 2. Good condition in TV 3. Installation demo is good 4. Picture and sound quality is good
227,4,Nice product,it is very good good MI LED TV 4A best picture quality HD very nice product
228,5,Perfect product!,"Mi smart Led TV gives tremendous competition to other high range LED Tvs as its picture and sound quality is superb, I got this Tvs in bigbillion days for 9999 only , Amazing fast delivery by Flipkart... Thankyou!"
229,5,Classy product,"Mi tv is the best u can get at this price. Connectivity is the only concern if your wifi signal is weak. I am using it with lan wire by Connecting it with router to TV and now it's working smooth. No brightness issue just keep the backlight to 70% plus and turn off dynamic lighting. Best TV in every respect. Sideload apps and everything will work except Netflix, for it you may require a normal mouse or air mouse."
230,4,Nice product,I use this tv last couple of weeks. Very satisfied with features. But When you connect HDMI cable we need to set the level of volume either set top box remote or TV remote. Otherwise over all functionality happy with me.
231,5,Best in the market!,"@very good quality, good picture, good sound, good connectivity net, value for money."
232,5,Simply awesome,"Awesome product on this price. I really satisfied. Thanks to both Flipkart and Mi for fast Delivery, Installation with Demo and Product.,. Picture Quality is best and I give 5/5. Sound quality is also best and I give 5/5. For example I took some pictures have a look..!!.. 👌😊👍"
233,4,Good quality product,pic quality is nice ..sound is upto the mark. look is nice and build quality also good.  wallmount screew hole positions are at different height and deep inside.. so u need longer screws and two different types of levelling rubber ×2 each..  flipkart says it has spdif port but there is no spdif port.. instead earphone port is there.. not sure if it can output digital (5.1 or 7.1) audio.  on software side ... when ever u switch the tv it starts android home by default... till now i have not got any option to change it to patch wall.  more review is comming in a few days..
234,4,Worth the money,"Display quality is reasonable, sound quality deals well according to the value of the product but connectivity with smartphone screen casting is bit weak and unstable. If you have great speed and stability of network -: WiFi, 4G etc, the connection is great and stable. Better option for online study."
235,5,Classy product,Just superb go for it with eyes closed.. it is a 2022 product it's remote is awesome with built in mic and connectivity is superb overall a best choice I would recommend this over sony as sony donot give Android at this price.. it is just awesome . you need hd cable connection for high definition it also works fine with sd
236,5,Best in the market!,"I am reviewing this Mi LED 4A pro after one week of usage. I got the delivery on the promise date given by Flipkart and the installation process is done within 2 days of delivery. For picture quality and connectivity I am giving 5 stars. For sound quality I am giving 4 star, some improvement must be needed in this sound section. But after all at this price range the product is awesome and you can experience the real feeling of a smart Android TV. I am expecting for the update comes with Netflix and Amazon prime."
237,5,Worth every penny,"Got Product on next day itself  Pros 1) Display is bright 2) Sound is good 3) Easy to install and use 4) Patch wall has much content 5) Best for its price 6) Free install and wall mount cost 400/- 7) 1GB Ram which is the same for 43,55 inch TVs. So as of now, it is really good.  Cons 1) Initial setup is taking too much time 2) The sound is not that much good but you can get decent sound for this price 3) Native apps suck. Install VLC as soon as you buy it. 4) Google UI is not that much good. Too many navigations to get one action done. 5) 90% of app sucks. Login design is too tough.   If you need HD go for 43 inch else this is the best product from MI in the price range of 10-20K"
238,1,Did not meet expectations,"Worst TV... as usual like MI phones, MI TVs also having only one plus point which is low price... MI's only motive is to give all the features in low price.. anyway that's a good idea... but wat about the quality of the products... low build quality low remote quality low connectivity quality.. everything this below average performance... display is somewhat good... but all other things is worst... If u r looking for a android TV don't go for MI... you can by VU.. of course VU is bit costlier than MI. but u will not have these issues... end of all money is matters... how much money u pay that much quality product u will get. I made a mistake... I should not buy mi... I should go for vu... vu is far better than mi"
239,4,Really Nice,"Very good product in this Price Range, Picture quality is perfect and the Patchwall works well but little bit felt slow here and there but not a big problem, Thanks for faster delivery by Ekart, and a guy from Jeeves visited for Installation on exact time as promised and did good job. But i am Sun direct user with basic plan so it is not so great in terms of Picture quality, should go for HD subscription for good picture quality in AV. Over all i am happy with this product. Need to test more things."
240,5,Great product,best tv in this price 👌 looking osm biggest think LCD TV it's good choice for this price voice is awesome is it use picture quality so sweet i like this TV and I am happy so select this TV it's a great choice and delivery facilities so good receive this TV on time thank you for r e-card delivery services..l
241,5,Awesome,Amazing TV with an very affordable price . Totally happy with the product . Initially I was a bit confused about the picture quality between HD & Full HD but after installing the TV I am surprised & satisfied with the picture quality . Coming to sound quality it's above average & Casting to TV is the main cons of this TV . After all the product is value for money & must be considered in its segment . I have paid under 12k including (wall mount & remote batteries) . The service by Jeeves is not satisfactory as they have installed the TV on the last day & last moment also the service engineer was not professional & gave less information about the TV .
242,4,Wonderful,It Very Nice Mi Tv Good Condition Valuable For Money But Installation Tv To Late Jeeves Pictures Quality Good Sounds Effectively Nice Can The Mi Tv In Flipkart It Great Delvery It On Time It Amazing.
243,5,Fabulous!,"I have placed order in Flipkart on 2-Dec-19, They delivered on Dec 3rd and on the same itself installation is done, This is first time I am buying smart TV, Before buying this TV I gone thru all negative reviews in that majority of the peoples are given negative rating for WIFI connectivity, I have used my WIFI connection and watched two full movie around 4hrs without any issue I can able to watch, In-between i don't see a single second clocking, The Picture quality is excellent,  Internet will work based on the bandwidth and signal, So everyone take my comments, I have wrote this comments after feeling a good experience with the smart TV, And now MI is fulfilled my dream.  So I am giving 5 of 5 rating for this MI 43"" TV and also for Flipkart for giving at Rs.20700/- best price."
244,5,Fabulous!,MI new launch product in Flipkart in best product in supply in MI TV 40 inch and best delivery ekart. low price product in my safe money to Flipkart bye
245,4,Very Good,"On 17 of August 2019 I have order this MI 4A 32 inch LED and on the 18 August 2019 I have received and on 19 August 2019 LED installation & Demo completed . So today is my First day with This LED TV , overall LED is best in given price .. Thank You Flipkart & MI"
246,4,Pretty good,A good Smart TV with competitive price tag. I searched for this type of TV for almost 6 months. looked all brands & some very good TVs from SAMSUNG & LG but choose MI TV in last because all other great brands were providing this kind of TV for something around 35-39k and I bought this for 23k so it saved my 12-16k. Not a great picture quality but happy to purchase it.
247,5,Fabulous!,"I have been using Mi smart TV for 2 months and it is perfect. Before that I had old big tummy wala TV. So this transition from old plasma screen to smart TV is fantabolous. WiFi connectivity is superb. So far, a great product at the best price"
248,3,Nice,Display colour quality is poor as compared to sony 43 inch android tv which i also use and my wifi speed is very high but the TV always keeps loading any videos played on Youtube or on any browser. Patchwall is not that useful. But considering the price it the best Smart Android TV one can buy. Cast feature is very useful and the google assistant button feature on the remote is also useful. A Value for money product
249,5,Awesome,. Mkv format not supported in available software. So download vlc media player first. And 1 additional benefit required offline screen mirroring. Google chromecast is not supported offline mirroring
250,1,Worthless,"Don’t buy MI LED Smart TV 4A Pro, I have purchased this tv on Jan 21, 2019 and giving this review. 1. Getting restarts by tv itself like MI phones 2. Loud beep sound coming after every 30 mins of using tv. 3. Brightness issue. 4. Neither Mi Company or Flipkart doesn’t care if issue comes or not because they are not ready to give replacement. They have only 10 days replacement. 5. Mi company gives only assure that product will work fine after repaired. But am not sure this tv will work fine after repaired also bcz in a span of one month am facing these many issues.  Guys pls don’t buy this tv or any MI products, its waste of money."
251,1,Terrible product,"Don't buy mi products. They seem to work normally at the starting but as months go by they don't work properly like the apps crash frequently, internet connectivity issues, bluetooth connectivity issues.... Look the price is low but this is not the product you want if you are planning for a long term basis. These mi products have a worst piece of software full of bugs ... Therefore I don't recommend buying this tv"
252,4,Good choice,"Such a nice product picture quality superbbb , sound awesome and connectivity is also good I like it but , installation services are too high according to my location so flipkart please work on them .......... 😊😊"
253,5,Brilliant,Good product and nice super good price
254,1,Hated it!,Please do not buy this tv. The display will be damaged after 1 year completed. If you purchase complete protection plan with this product for 3 year. They do not provide good service. I bought this tv with complete protection plan. They took my tv but didnt refund my amount yet. So please do not buy this type of product ever. I have a worst experience with this product.
255,5,Super!,After using 1 year. Tv was superb and connectivity are also very godd and available in tv in my price is 11000 befire 1 year ago. Awsome item u must br buy mi tv. If you find 32 inch tv so i suggested mi tv 32 inch is good for u.
256,5,Fabulous!,Believe me this is the best smart tv you could get upto 30k.This is just awesome..dnt go with the negetive reviews.Its the best deal.I got it for 16300 after card discount.Just and just a minor drwaback its a bit slow sometimes and thats obvious with 1 gb ram..so its just mindblowing.Go for it without giving a single thought.
257,5,Wonderful,Mi tv very nice clarity is very nice sach a nice tv value of money👍👍👍👍
258,5,Awesome,It is an amazing product low cost best futures in this product and high picture quality some body tells picture is not clear in this Android TV it's full hd display iam very happy to by this product and thanks to flipcart deliver in correct date and time .
259,1,Did not meet expectations,Please don't go with this product if you really like to see with good sound. The sound quality is very poor. The background sound will be very high and dialogues will be very low. Whatever settings you do it remains same.. better choose wisely.
260,3,Nice,"Best good awesome for small family. Chiz badi achi hai... I like it.,, I bought it on 5 feb 2020."
261,5,Awesome,"I have been using this Tv for a couple of months now and I'm quite satisfied with the performance. As such i haven't had any problems. The picture quality is good and you can set the picture based on your preference by going into their advance settings, mostly watching online tv shows which requires the internet connectivity they have provided the RJ45 port to connect your LAN cable or you use the WiFi which is an initial setup when you boot up the TV for the first time. The sound quality is quite clear, the TV also gives you the provision of attaching external speakers via the 3.5mm audio out port or you can simply connect your bluetooth speaks and listen to the audio. Being an Android OS tv the Play Store has the usual applications which are made for the TV and receive updates quite often, initial updates are huge for the OS. The TV has the provision of casting your phone via Chormecast which is inbuilt. The remote being simplistic is the best thing a small and light weight remote which connects via bluetooth too, pairing the remote is quite easy. Make sure you keep the user manual and don't lose it or give it away while the installation.  The wall mounts are an additional cost which the installer offers.  To summarise, it's a TV you will really be satisfied buying."
262,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"Received this Mi LED Smart TV 4A Pro (43) in good condition and installation was done perfectly. Got the update (Android 9) after installation is completed and reviewed all the features one by one. After few days, tried using the (Timer Functionality & Screen OFF) mode, while playing MP3 and watching YouTube videos and later observed that POWER button in Remote got Disabled and used Google Assistant to Turn OFF the TV. After this I got little bit confused and tried Google search for Troubleshooting, later did a Factory Reset. After this it came to normal mode again, but again tried the same testing again and faced the same issue again. Later I escalated this issue to Mi Support and they arranged for Motherboard Replacement to resolve this issue. But after replacing the Motherboard did the same Testing and faced the same issue again. Later came to conclusion that this is a Software BUG and not an Hardware issue. Mi Support team agreed that this is related to Software BUG and they have escalated to Mi R&D team and expected to get this BUG fix later by end of December 2019 software update. Later Mi Support team have promised to replace this existing TV with New TV and today (04.Dec.2019) support person is coming to replace the new motherboard with original old motherboard and will be getting the replacement new TV by this week. I will update once replacement new TV is received from Mi Team (Date of Purchase, Oct'2019)."
263,5,Highly recommended,nice budget led in 40 inch full hd and full of functions good sound good picture quality. go for it you will not regret
264,4,Good quality product,"TV is good, Clarity is at par with Sony. overall good product I am not happy with remote control. Power off and voice assist buttons are placed so close often both get pressed simultaneously. There is no Mute button on the remote."
265,5,Terrific,excellent led mi is tha best brand for led TVs thanks you flipkart
266,4,Worth the money,"Nice led tv. Initially when we seeing the quality of picture is not find so good little light shade is there but after one update it brings to good. and also if Hd cable set up box is there than it will further improve, we bought it for around 15000 with exchange of old tv. overall good deal and good tv."
267,5,Awesome,"really something wonderful happened... fully smart LED youtube , netflix , hotstar, Sony liv , voot all avilable... mirror casting is very smooth after i updated the device .... same day installation as on delivery.. best experience with flipcart"
268,5,Worth every penny,The TV is good. picture quality is good for the price. super connectivity. Prime video works after andriod 9.0 update. Good TV for the budget price. Thanks to flipkart. The installation service also good.
269,5,Must buy!,I was like in doubt how the mi will perform... but after buying this I was totally satisfied... got it installed by Jeeves on the same day of delivery and also got the update to PIE after 2 days of installation... very fast update.. also coming to brightness issues.. if you turn off the dynamic backlight then you will not have any kind of brightness issue...totally satisfied with the product.. totally recommend it...
270,4,Value-for-money,"Brilliant TV in 18k. Picture quality is great. It just don't have enough brightness. The sound is loud enough. I noticed these cons- low brightness, connection keeps dropping off from screen cast, Bluetooth connection also drops sometime, 1gb ram is slight less. Doesn't seem something that can be used excessively. Pros- best in price, beautiful picture quality,works above expectations if used lightly. My piece of advice - Go for it if you want a budget smart TV."
271,5,Highly recommended,"Well, first of all I will recommend everyone to buy this TV and the reason behind this is its quality, and other features in very low amount. I got this TV in 22,000 Rs. under offer. It has been 4 months using this TV and I didn't find any problem in this TV. Its sound quality is amazing and if you want something more in sound era then you can buy MI sound bar for only 5000 which will give a new boost to your TV. Talking about its PROS: Display is too good and there is not any problem of brightness and such other screen issues. You will get Patchwall in it and with the help of that you can watch anything just on your TV but remember you have to pay for OTT apps in Patchwall but my advice is that you should watch all of them for free and if you want to know how you can watch free TV and episodes, movies, etc, then goto my YouTube Channel MR SHIVARTH, i have uploaded there a video, also I have shown you all the TV things in another video of my channel. Chromecast is inbuilt in this so you will be able to share your smartphone screen on your TV and you will also have Google Assistant support in it and you can avail this with the help of a remote where there are few buttons to operate TV and remember you will not get battery in it. Another thing to remember is to not open box by yourself because if product has somewhere dent or damaged you will not be able to replace that and also your warranty will not be claimed by you and becomea void. So its better to get your TV box opened by service technician. The technician will come from Jeeves and on the same day of delivery or next day you will get your TV installed in your room. You need to pay 500 for wall mount if you want your TV to hang on wall and if you want to place it on Table then you don't need to pay any extra money to Technician. You will get Android Oreo in the TV but in future you will be able to see Android Pie support in MI 43 inch Pro TV. After this you get many types of ports in the TV like HDMI, USB, etc., and 43 inch is not that big as well as not that small so you can definitely go for it. Hoping, this review will help you and finally you will never get any issue in claiming warranty."
272,5,Terrific purchase,"super clarity, sound quality also very good and high sound. I really really love it. thank for flipkart. worth for money."
273,3,Just okay,Product is good. Sound output is crisp n clear in small room but in hall its little fading. Display quality is awesome can play full hd videos in youtube.Wifi connectivity is good. Only con is that it automatically gets off sometimes observed 4 to 5 times in 4 months of purchase.
274,5,Awesome,Best tv which gives all features as other smart tv in market. Am very happy with that MI gives such good tv in that price and the 32inch tv is good for a family for 3-4people.

285,3,Does the job,Editing my review after one month. The most annoying thing is that the brightness fluctuates while we are watching. It becomes darker all of the sudden. I might have to change this after a few months. The only good thing is the sound quality Don't go for it.
286,3,Just okay,Products gud and sound effects also nice picture quality also fine..but connectivity has not bad.some of times it will nt work like hanged..so improve the connectivity problem It would be a value of money .suggest to improve
287,5,Classy product,I purchase this Mi TV 32 inch to use it as a monitor for my PC. It works flawlessly and I am enjoying doing my work on big screen. The TV comes with two table top stand which is very easy to install and gets easily fitted. It also has multiple ports so we can connect multiple devices at the same time. The display quality is also very good. Xiaomi is providing great specs products at very reasonable prices. I am very satisfied with the over all quality of this product from Xiaomi.
288,1,Useless product,"This tv is so outdated ! 1 gb ram is not enough to run apps smoothly ! Picture quality is good in FHD , but in this rate one can buy a 4k tv in other brands."
289,4,Very Good,Product is good as per the price as I bought it @18499 so as per price product quality and availability is superb but on second hand the person's who were responsible to install it were so irritating that they even not picking up the call so please do improve after sale service. And if you guys want to buy insurance do buy it online as it goes expensive when purchased offline as per my stake I feel it's important to purchase the insurance for 3 years so that everything would be covered in the...

316,4,Value-for-money,"Great tv in budget price. The only thing i dint like but it the installation process. The person who comes for installation is polite and good but what i dint like about installation process is when i called them(jeeves service) with other number for paid service i received 3 calls in 24hrs for paid installation but not single call for free installation i made 3-4 call from my end. So my question is , the installation which we getting from Flipkart is like a bhik and we are bhikaris for them? They called continuously for paid services but not interested in the work which has been assigned to them and we cant install tv ourself because they have so called warranty policy. Better go for offline market and buy tv with warranty and install according to ur convenient."

330,5,Brilliant,it was delivered before time and installed within 24 hrs. picture quality and sound is too good . Wall mounting bracket costs Rs 399 was given by installation engineer but good bracket is available for Rs 250 online .but the installation engineer drilled a 4 in hole to fix a 1.5 in screw to tighten the wall mounting bracket due to which tv might fall but I fixed it well myself afterwards.

335,5,Excellent,"Hi I am here sharing review of Mi led. I ordered the LED on 20 th June and it is delivered and installed on 22 June . very good service by flipkart. Sound quality is awesome. video clarity is also very good connectivity is very nice , can be connected speakers through bluetooth. Pachtwall fn is awesome. cast is also working very nicely. play store is also there. overall value for money . go for it. Highly recommended."
336,4,Good choice,Sound Is very Powerful. picture quality is ok as comparing to price. Don't expect Sony or sharp TV quality here . Picture quality on Hotstar and YouTube working good depending upon your internet speed. Always use 720p on YouTube or Hotstar to view good quality.  Installation is third class Flipkart has to rectify this serious concern but they are not listening to their Flipkart plus members even. Shame on Flipkart this time. If you want quick installation then go to local dealers or pay the charges to any private technician and installed on the same same. But if you install locally Flipkart may voud your warranty.
337,4,Worth the money,best view with Best features with lower cost hope I am happy with this TV right jnow
338,3,WALL HANGING UNIT IS NOT AVAILABLE .WE PAY EXTRA RS. 400.,PRODUCT IS GOOD. WALL HANGING UNIT IS NOT AVAILABLE WITH MI LED SMART TV 4A PRO 80 CM(32)TELEVISION. WE GAVE EXTRA RS. 400 FOR INSTALLATION.
339,4,Value-for-money,* Hd channel picture clearity is good but there is bright Ness issue in daylight condition. * SD channel picture clearity normal * Sound quality fabulous. For using Smart Tv feature smoothly all we need unlimited broadband connection with speed above 400 Kbps & paid subscription of all the channels in patchwall & most important thing is Time to watch all these channels.
340,5,Brilliant,product is good and installation person behavior is very excellent and cooperative and service is also good
341,5,Simply awesome,"Nice screen size, picture quality is good with hd vedios, Google assistance is good overall a good product at this price. The concern for me is the durability of this tv because first time i have diverted away from LG and Sony. Overall good product installation was before time cheers to the installation team."

351,4,Delightful,"Real genuine review. Tv is great and all well delivered. But you guys have chosen such pathetic partners to do the installation, they don't even bother to come. Kindly improve that aspect and it would be cherry on the top like thing."
352,5,Perfect product!,Its really fullfill middle class people's dream to get big screen size TV with good price & super features.. We really got excitement with MI TV 4A PRO 43inch tv.. good time delivery & installation..
353,4,Good quality product,Value for money. Positives: 1. Android TV with built in Chromecast makes it easy to stream content. 2.Google assistant and voice search is pretty handy and helps in avoiding typing anything with the onscreen keyboard. 3. A big 43 inch smart tv for the price closer to what big shots in the industry charge for a 32 inch. Only couple of negatives 1. No matter what I do with the brightness settings TV seems to maintain same brightness. 2. Every time we switch in the tv we have to manually select the input source.  overall still good for the money paid. better don't watch it without any light in the room.
354,4,Very Good,wow nice delivery package fast delivery awesome feature mi LED TV

In settings if you turn off the HDR backlight option, then TV has high brightness level. Don't hesitate to buy MI TV, really i am very happy about my decision of buying this TV. Thanks MI for providing good product at affordable price."
359,5,Great product,"What a purchase, kudos to Xiaomi and Flipkart. Sound quality of this TV is awesome and more than average picture quality it has. Once Flipkart stands tall in their commitments. In one word worthy purchase."
360,3,Good,product is good but system is very slow and ang system I'm the display quality is very good always sound superb TV but processor is not better so many legs
361,4,Worth the money,"Superb TV Value for money, Picture quality is good (4/5), Sounds Quality is Good (4/5), Recommended to Buy, Worth Buying"
362,4,Pretty good,Finally....!!! I Got My Favourite Mi Led TV After So Many Wait And It's Supppperb... Package In This Price Great Job By Mi And Just Awesome Mi TV At This Price And Installation And Demo Is Also Very Fast And Secure By The Jeewes But My 2 Years Extended Warranty Card Not Giving Me Thanks So Much Mi And Flipkart
363,5,Mind-blowing purchase,Mi 4A pro is a good picture quality and sound quality is also awesome. Congratulations for giving me a good product in a best price.
364,4,Value-for-money,it's value for money sound quality is very good but internet connection is not pretty good but overall it good
365,4,Good choice,"Good tv at this price but I feel cheated, originally I want to buy TCL TV because same specification at lower price plus wall mounts but When I got mi tv it says manufacturers by TCL. Second after update it has mirroring issues. Third almost all app are paid. Like hot star is working fine on my phone and almost all TV series (except few English series) free, but on TV version it needs subscription. Almost less than 1% app are available on playstore. Sorry guys but vu and Thompson tv android version has more options. It's looks like mi intentionally has stopped some function"
366,5,Just wow!,"Very good tv. It has very good picture quality, good sound quality only if you watch dth channels but not good for 1080p action movies & viewing angles are also good & connectivity options are good. If you find my review helpful please hit like button."
367,4,Delightful,"For the price, yes its worth the buy  Picture quality is ok Sound cud be better, main issue is regarding crisp clear audio thats missing else is quite ok for low volume watchers I feel, it takes a little nap time in getting connected from one port to another. Even theres delays while playing from USB.  Overall, worth the money paid."
368,5,Terrific purchase,This TV is just WoW.. Super fast delivery by Flipkart. Delivery and Installation with demo was on the same date. Everything is same as described. Totally satisfied with the Product. Its worthy..
369,4,Really Nice,"TV is good sound is superb, connectivity is also fine, but the picture quality is little bit disappointed, it looks like a HD ready quality. Demo & installation is done with in time thanks to flipkart.😊"
370,5,Super!,"It is really a nice product of MI , It's picture & sound likely equal as my Samsung 43 inches led TV . it's customer service is very first and impressed and Flipkart delivery is also very first."
371,5,Must buy!,"I giving review after 15 days buying.evrything is good picture, sounds, quantity and multimedia content also.I'm very happy and satisfied with this mi led smart TV 4A pro(43)in this range."
372,4,Good choice,Good product in this price.. screen casting option bit difficult.. both device should be in the same network.. other than that clarity is pretty good..
373,1,Useless product,"Installation is not done yet, scheduled twice. After making calls many time, I was informed by the technician that it would take 2 or 3 days more as wall mount stand is not in stock. Ho gyi aisi tessi excitement ki. Better to buy it from mi directly. Almost 3 out of 4 customers have complained against jeeves. Why don't u take care of it as still there is no improvement in this regard"
374,5,Super!,Excellent product and valuable for many and installation fast service provide thank you very much flipkart and team
375,3,Decent product,"Updated after 1.5 month: 1. Netflix/Prime Video are officially supported. 2. Chromescast is just a pain to connect (restart mobile/TV). It may frustrate you for 1+ Hrs. 3. Android Pie 9 update: Slowere OS load on first boot  Old: First of all, I really don't understand what's the purpose of this TV when there are just limited sets of apps on Android Play Store.  Disclaimer: Pics are not uploaded as it failed.  I wanted to go for just Smart TV but thought of evolving and updates from MI and Android. Fingers crossed.  Coming to review: Pros: - Best in class picture quality from front. It's minor fade from side angles. (Videocon D2H HD works awesome). Even SD channels are good. - Sound is not the best but not disappointing at all. It's HD feel of sound due to speakers. Good job there. - I had no issues with Connectivity to be precise. It's just flawless. (Still on Mobile tethering) - Screen is big as I have 43'. Add this to your hall. - Casting your android device to TV is easy, thanks to Chromescast and one touch. (Install Google Home in your mobile?  Cons: - Pathwall is just a garbage which most of us will never open. It has OTT apps but all paid. - No Netflix, Prime, Airtel, Vodafone TV apps along with many. A big disappointment from MI and Google Android TV app Store. - Remote is just to use when you need it. A button press changes your screen. Be careful. - Doesn't come with Wall Mount. Have to spend extra for same. - Android eats up your space for nothing. Manageable but should be more as the apps and services are not enough from Android."
376,5,Terrific purchase,its perfect led TV if u looking in low bagate.picture quality is awesome. before I buy this TV I was little worry about brightness but trust me there is no any issue of brightness.there are many option for picture quality and brightness controll in setting .turn on backlight brightness it make good quality picture.so overall a like the picture qaulity.sound quality is good but connectivity little bit slow .delivery was on the time and next day installation also done
377,4,Pretty good,Good pictures and videos quality good internet connection good average price very good
378,5,Awesome,best product value of money picture quality is awesome and sound is good its a smart tv youtube and hotstar and zee5 in install this tv i think it is a bst tv for midrange buyers thats all 👍☺☺
379,4,Delightful,sound clarity awesome ....worth for money ....Fast installation .....little bit screen quality missing compare with other leading brands ....otherwise worthy
380,4,Wonderful,"After a use for a month, this is my review - the sound quality is amazing as compared to other TV in this range. picture quality is good as per price. Cons - Whenever I try to play any video from zee5, it gives a missing file error. Cannot connect to any of the Bluetooth devices. One of the stand was missing with this product so had to pay 400 for wall mount."
381,5,Worth every penny,Outstanding product with amazing sound clarity and quality as well as easy to use and operate. Thank you Flipkart & MI.
382,4,Wonderful,"I don't know more technical details but, I am not quite happy with sound and picture quality of TV. it maybe it's kinda new technology. the installation guy charged INR. 1850 for wall mount no bill, not sure why it is too expensive. otherwise flipkart service was good . my Order was placed on Saturday and I got TV installed by Monday 2PM. so quick delivery and installation. thanks"
383,5,Best in the market!,Delivery person Mr.Shankar was very co operative and supportive . I am impressed with kind behaviour he had and way he was treating. Employees like him helps and play vital role in delivering the optimum level if satisfaction.
384,5,Mind-blowing purchase,product is awesome but service of flipkart is very poor.no one came for installation of LED and date of installation is also expired and they told me to wait for 48 hours or 5 days product is good but I prefer another app for shopping
385,4,Pretty good,"I am writing this review, after using two days. superb picture, nice sound clarity, HD 4k also played. Hurry up, if u are interested to operate a new world. Thanks to Flipkart , for sending technical person and fast delivery. Nice packaging. Don't hesitate about purchasing. There are multiple function to operate the TV. please see another review if confuse occurred."
386,4,Very Good,"Myself am very satisfied with this product. The sound and picture quality are too good, without Hd channels also it is looking like Hd clarity, screen mirroring is the only lagging issue in android it requires 2 smart phones to operate.. i.e., In another mobile we have to make it hotspot ON and in our mobile we have to operate with Wi-Fi .you will get all benefits in this MI TV as like as other brands but i will give only 4 rating because of that screen mirroring is not at all working properly atleast once. I had very disappointed in this particular option. if incase it works, I don't hesitate to give 5 stars.👌👍👍"
387,5,Terrific Purchase considering the Price Point !!!,"I have been using the MI TV 4 PRO 43 Inch since the past 2 weeks & I am totally satisfied by it. At this price range this the best deal that you will get and trust me you will not be dissapointed at all. The colors on the TV are good, It comes pre installed with Hotstar , You Tube and other apps. Patchwall from MI is excellent. You can also install many other Android TV apps like the Prime Video, Firefox , show box etc and it runs smoothly without any problem at all. The only con that i found was that the MI TV does not support Netflix yet but this restriction is more from Netflix side as there are certain parameters which MI is working upon. Overall , a great buy . Go for it without any doubt. !!!!"
388,1,Hated it!,Picture quality is not upto mark. I have one Micromax TV have excellent quality in same D2H connection. Even though it is 6 years old not a smart TV but Micromax is much much better than MI.  connect with phone also not much good  I will rate it 2/10 only.  Waste of money
389,1,Unsatisfactory,"cast screen connectivity is very very poor, once it's connected to your mobile then it will take 5 to 10 second to deliver picture on TV Picture quality is very poor, if you have normal set top box then you must buy HD set top box overall it's a HD ready TV I think Micromax led TV is better than MI in order to picture quality."
390,5,Awesome,very good picture quality and good product i give 5 star rating. i have a only one problem in my mi 4a pro tv need to update new version after use cromcast that is only problem. another all is well good thanks flipcart and seller.
391,5,Must buy!,"TV is awesome. It has the best picture quality as it has FHD display & best connectivity, specially Google Chromecast and Google assistance (voice search) are fast responsive. The only 2 minor issues i faced were, 1. It could be more brighter as the backlighting of tv seems little dim. 2. Its speakers has not amazing sound quality, However, there is 20W output, but I didn like sound quality its normal sound."
392,5,Worth every penny,"Not a lot of apps available in play store that are useful(not a single browser,no jio tv)only good thing is in built Chromecast but can't recommend the TV just for that. pathetic product in the name of smart android."
393,5,Great product,"product is excellent, value for money. I got it for 11,499 rs, (10% off max upto 1000rs on SBI credit and debit card). You have to pay extra rs 399 for a fix wall mount however you can get a flexi mount for the same amount in market or online. I bought a flexi mount stand for rs 400 in market. The installation is free of cost. Also the MI remote does not come with batteries so you have to buy batteries for the same. If you find brightness to be on lower side them then go in the setting menu then in pictures option swith off adaptive brightness, Viola brightness is increased."
394,1,Worst experience ever!,NYC tv install is good miraz is also good person he is very gud engineer and tv also gud product I so very lucky I choose mi led tv thanks flipkart
395,5,Highly recommended,"got in 8900 . amazing TV. you can enjoy all the stuff without tv connection. youtube, hotstar, SONY tv app working smoothly without any lags. movie from USB also work smoothly. it's also supporting 1tb external hard disk , you can enjoy your favorite movie anytime."
396,5,Awesome,Good product. but the display should be better at my point of view... otherwise it is ok.. and Good behaviour of Installation service man...
397,1,Worthless,This MI branded TV is absolutely average. I bought it over other comparable brands like TCL or Toshiba trusting them MI brand and service Center network.  1.The remote control has Spartan controls so it is very difficult to navigate through available features and basic input options.  2. The picture quality is below average with poor brightness even at maximum setting  3. Sound fidelity is inferior to other comparable TV brand and one needs to crank up the volume for better audio. That causes corresponding increase in noise  Buying this TV seems like a poor decision on hindsight considering that the product cannot be returned unless there is a manufacturing defect.
398,5,Terrific purchase,Good Picture and Sound Quality. Worth for money. Easy access and good Android system installed. Installation taken 3 days.
399,5,Great product,"Don't know why people goes for Sony,Samsung and LG with more cost ,This is the best one....best clearity and sound quality is awesome than other....I am very happy with MI...."
400,5,Brilliant,"After doing so many research ended up buying this ,though it wasn't on priority being China company.hobwer didn't find any other brand close to this model feature. I really like products and it's working absolutely fine after 6 months. Great value for money"
401,3,Does the job,"For first two weeks everything was good and correct as mentioned in the product discription . But later I felt lot of connectivity issues, everytime I have to reset it again and again . And Google assistant is not working, very worst experience, I brought it manily for Google assistant, so that everyone in my family can operate it by voice , even my grandma. So it disappoints a lot. Picture quality I good so far, sound is also same from beginning but sound seems to be not that clear. Don't buy this product , look for other better tv"
402,4,Worth Money,"This review I am writing after 2 years of use . The TV is an awesome product . Pros : Display quality is best , Sound quality is best , there is no lag in tv till now(May 2021) . Everything is great . I also got 1-2 software updates .  Cons : Only problem that I had was that even if it was connected to internet it showed no internet access. But later on I changed some settings and now it is working fine ."
403,5,Terrific,"TV is good but I got quite high price, wait as always offer is there and you can get at 12,500 best price At end TV is best in all brand."
404,5,Worth every penny,Overall a good purchase in this price range. If you budget is 15k then it is only best choice with more than enough features.
405,3,Good,TV is good but it not support Google Home app for connect mobile to TV. TV has miracast app that support only mi mobile. Mirroring of mobile to TV not happen.
406,4,Value-for-money,"After using it for 2 weeks, No issues. Best features at the price provided. Wall mount stand is not provided which is not good. Installation guys/external service providers charge 500-600 for the stand which is not worth 50rs. This charge covers for more than the installation charges and customer is fooled with the so called ""free installation"". The service provider ""Jeeve's also used cheap tactics to sell their other products like stabilizer. The guy was like threatening me that if I don't buy and install stabilizer then we might not be able to cover ur TV for the additional 3 year warranty which I bought at additional 1200. I would recommend ppl not to go for additional warranty and it's not going to help out. It's time Flipkart/MI (not sure of agreements with respect to installation) checks on this and have a reliable and honest installation provider."
407,4,Good quality product,"I am writing this review after 3 weeks of usage. The picture and sound quality are good. Connectivity is also decent. The best feature is data saver as most small towns and villages in India are far from reach of high speed broadband. So you can easily connect to your mobile hotspot without consuming data too much provided the picture quality is not set to very high quality.  Initially I faced some issue with the mirror cast using Google home app. It may work one or two times but then it will start hanging, only shows volume up and down on TV screen. After lots of reasearch, I found Castto screen mirroring app from Play Store which is the best app. So this is just the app issue and not related to tv."
408,5,Fabulous!,"Writing after use of 6 months. Best in budget TV. Don't compare it with picture quality of sony and LG. As you have to pay double of what you are paying for MI.  Bought this Tv in 16500. And fully satisfied with performance.  1. TV channels are clear enough even for Non- HD channels.  2. Sound is very good.  3. Internet connectivity is good. I can play any ott channel without any issue.  4. Screen Cast is not Good, if you are playing video in your MI mobile and want to cast it on MI tv, then video lags. Voice and video are different.  5. After watching your MI tv, if you watch LG and Sony, then definitely you will feel picture quality difference. But why to do that.  Verdict : Good tv in budget. If you are looking for showoff to your guests then buy sony. If you want a best budget class TV with all features and 90 percent of picture quality of sony/LG, this TV suits to your home and pocket."
409,5,Just wow!,I love this MI TV because it's having very clearity for picture and sound was very good and length also good totally I feel very happy for brought this product and thank you for Filpkart Cart and Delivery person
410,5,Awesome,This hd tv is very good quality mi tv is good and flipkart installation is very fast thanks ekart thanks jeeves service and thanks flipkart im very happy
411,3,Nice,"Picture quality is not so good. It looks like HD ready. Sound is also not so loud. It is not as per my expectations. I had samsung 32 inches full HD tv earlier, picture quality of samsung was very impressive in comparison to MI tv. And I internet connectivity is very poor. MI Tv is not taking it' update. It is getting failed again and again. Over all I am not happy with that. Adding 2000-3000, we can get better brand tv like motorola, realme, Nokia."
412,5,Classy product,"I purchased mi 4a pro TV online through Flipkart. First off all I am happy for the service of Flipkart. Also as far as mi TV are concerned definitely product is best. All the features are nice that is picture, sound, clearity. I am very much thankful to Flipkart for best service and availability of this wonderful product. In future, I also expect best service from Flipkart for each product."
413,5,Highly recommended,This is perfect size.. 43 was too big and 32 was too small.. Price is also very good for this product.. Picture quality is nice it is Full HD.. Easy to operate.. Remote control is very user friendly.. Please do not open TV box by urself wait for authorized installation engineer to visit ur home.. As it could violate TV warranty.. I also own a Mi 32 inch LED that is also working fine since more than 3.5 years.. Would recommend everyone to buy wall stand from Mi official app or site as there wall stand is perfect fit with there LED and quality and durability is good.
414,5,Excellent,"I had used Thomson smart Tv before buying this. Compared to Thomson, Mi TV is way ahead. Good picture quality, Best value for money( I bought it for 11984)"
415,5,Mind-blowing purchase,Value for money product. Picture quality is very good & no connectivity issue faced till now. I was expecting better sound quality but it’s decent. TV works well with broadband connection (fiber connection is recommended). Overall I am very happy with the product & would recommend to others as well. Thanks !
416,5,Super!,Awesome product as described and good in delivery as well as installation. Completely satisfied with the product as well as the services provided.
417,5,Must buy!,Best product picture quality super look super performance super value of money best all in one MI TV 40 inches
418,4,Good quality product,"This is an awesome TV in this prize range.Thank you mi The picture quality is just awesom because it's only supports hd only.sound clarity is not bad.If you want better sound experience please connect external home theater to the TV. The other features such as internet connectivity, Chromecast and movie player are awesome."
419,5,Just wow!,"I bought this TV last week and it is worthy product. At this price the smart TV options are great. Connectivity with WiFi is excellent when we have good network coverage. The display in HD mode is fantastic. When you connect DTH without HD, the picture quality is not good. Sound system is better when comparing to VU, Panasonic, Kodak in this range. Not sure about Samsung and LG TVs. TV remote is handy and beautifully designed. Most of the video formats are supported (avi,MP3,MP4,mkv,etc). Overall I give 4.5/5 rating for this product. The Flipkart delivery service - 5/5 for this particular product which was delivered professionally."
420,5,Fabulous!,"The TV is a good trade, keeping the price point in mind, but if we see the features singularly, we'll find traces of price cutting attitude from Xiaomi in almost every point. But, it is still reasonable. Only sound is a point where I find it very poor and recommend the prospective buyers to keep a budget of around 5k to 6k higher to their TV budget coz you'll definitely sense a need for getting a good sound system (be it soundbar or home theater) to upgrade the poor sound quality that the TV emits out of its bottom facing speakers. Rest, I find the product good and price worthy."
421,5,Terrific,"The product is just awesome... I am a very conservative person in terms of rating a product...but believe me I am very satisfied with the product.  The picture clarity, connectivity, user friendly...all good...my 5yr old kid can use it at ease. Sound is good no doubt...but if you have a fascination...you can go for a sound bar or so...but to my advice..it's not required...all is well.  Its a smart tv and it's remote can't be synchronised with the DTD HD remote.  I used SBI card with 10% cash back offer and I got that at 11,250/-  The installation was done the very next day though I was offered the installation the same day. Very smooth installation and they charged 399/- extra for the wall clamp. Else it's free.  Friends I strongly recommend the product in all aspects and also advice you to avail the Flipkart 3yrs warranty to have complete peace of mind.  Stay safe.. Thanx"
422,4,Mi 4A 100 cm(40) Full HD Picture Quality,"Product is Nice and picture Quality is good but net connectivity is to slow ,Mi TV feature is in good and TV remote is working well.otherwise all is well and good product . Very Fast delivery of flipkart on doorstep thanks to flipkart ."
423,5,Wonderful,"Best in price... 1.Awesome picture quality 2. Sound is descent. 3. The best thing about TV is... It is a whole unit with computing power with 1gb ram and 8 gb rom having inbuilt microphone for Google assistant. You can play any type of video format using apps from play store... (MX PLAYER, VLC) 4.Can play games on TV with mobile ""android remote"" application using TouchPad in the aap."
424,4,Delightful,I purchased this mi 4a pro tv 32 inch june 2020. I was very impressed with the quality of audio and video. Very good and value for money. Spend 12k on such a smart tv is budget oriented. Mi is super for providing such a great product to the customers. I am happy to get this low budget smart tv
425,5,Brilliant,"Delivery is fasted. We have three option in this category, like realms, mi , and one plus. I love one plus brand for phone. One + tv has better look than rest. But Mi tv is definately more superior than realme and one plus in terms of video and audio quality. By chance, happy to buy MI tv"
426,5,Great product,"Picture quality very good, sound quality very good good homepage. But it takes more time when we switch on it compare to conventional LED TV. Overall good product in this price range"
427,4,Nice product,Picture quality us good but don't expect it to be crystal clear for short distances... Audio is good with full volume...Better to connect to speakers.. Connectivity is good and the MIUI (Patchwall) is working consistently.
428,4,Really Nice,"I had a Sony Bravia Full HD LED Tv earlier,and as compared to that, picture quality is inferior and specially while using a normal STB.... YouTube pic quality is variable according to the resolution u choose..... PROs: 1.Android Tv at such a Cheap rate 2.Built in WiFi with Chromecast....NB: many people complained that Chrome cast is not working properly but in my set...its working fine 3.Light weight 4.Bluetooth remote 5.Can install custom apks  CONs: 1.Although HD ready but is not at all comparable to premium TVs like SONY 2.TV needs to be switched on by remote every time after u switch on d main supply 3.Remote buttons are not easy to press 4.No wall mount and battery available in the box...need to buy separately  N.B: Got the product installed next day of delivery by a Flipkart authorised agent but he only did d installation and didn't even showed the basic features n demos although he was supposed to do that. Inference:If u r looking for a budget TV within 15K.,u can go for it without any hesitation."
429,5,Just wow!,"Good Product and good picture quality.Data saver is a good feature.Even in low internet speed,we can see movies"
430,5,Best in the market!,The device is working properly and the installation was easy as well. The technician was very humble. I'm happy with the service. :))
431,5,Highly recommended,"Received and got the product installed in two days even it is lockdown. Great support on installation.  Picture quality, connectivity and sound are great... Only compliant is, In the the beginning I was able to 4K and more option in YouTube videos but now I can able to see only 1080p"
432,4,Good choice,"Pros: Good Picture Quality. Good Sound Volume. Good viewing angle. Build quality. Value for money. Simple but good remote control.  Cons: Takes lot of time to start up. Many of the video files in USB device are not supported. 4k resolution videos can’t be played(it should play by downscaling to HD quality). Screen mirroring not so good. Hissing noise at background when external speakers are connected through headphone jack. Ports are mounted at inaccessible location.  Final verdict: TV is good for watching contents from a dth/cable set top box. Not recommended if you use playing movies from USB devices frequently, especially high resolution videos."
433,5,Terrific,"Awsome as always , loved it .. I use it for my PS4 too it's awsome 🙂"
434,5,Must buy!,"Writing the review after one year of usage. 1. With this price, its really awesome 2. Because of one GB of RAM you can't install many applications. I'm using hotstar, Netflix and Zee5 and some inbuilt apps like youtube. For these apps I'm getting some nice user experience. 3. Power on taking some 1 minute after the system update recently by google. 4. You can't directly cast your full mobile screen to TV. For that you need a wifi connection in which the TV and your mobile should be connected. 5. Most of the application has its own casting options, so that you can directly cast only that apps (youtube, hotstar, amazonprime as such) over your mobile hotspot to tv. 6. MxPlayer is not supporting to this TV. 7. Remove is very lite and small. It is easy to hold. And you can operate within 10 to 15 metre radius.  Overall experience, good."
435,4,Worth the money,"I bought this tv a week before.  Delivery was done as promised and on the same installation was done (one day before promised).  1. Quality of tv is ok but it cannot be compared with other brands like Sony, Samsung or LG. 2. Comes with both andriod and patch both are good but you cannot install many other application like sun next, good browsers etc., 3. Picture quality is good for HD channel for SD you might notice minor back spots(if absorbed closely) 4. Pannell is not so good but above average. 5. Sound quality is good while watching HD content but on SD it is average. 6. There is a connectivity problem (chromecast). First time when it was installed I was not able to conmect my mobile through chrome cast then demo guy said to lodge complaint with flipkart so that they can replace the tv. Later he did the complete software reset and then it start to work but till there is a problem. 7. Internet connectivity is good. 8. Bluetooth speakers need to placed next to the tv else you will hear lot of voice breaks. 9. There is not mute option in the remote. 10. After reboot or when we turn on tv it will take time to load (more than 30 seconds) 11. It is just like mobile without call option. 12. For wall mount they charged me 1600 (stretchable) and bill was not provided.(please dont buy it from installation person quality is bad) I realised it later.(normal wall mount rs 500) 13. Installation was done well but did not explain all the features. 14. No battery for remote. 15. As I said earlier cannot compare with any other brand TV's. if you are looking for least cost then you can go for this."
436,5,Wonderful,Good product on this price range and most thing is it's very good in connectivity with all features Installation guys was also satisfied with his service overall I can say it's good product on Flipkart
437,3,Decent product,"Picture quality is not good even in 1080 resolution also it's looks like 480 resolution , the display quality is average it's not looks colorful. In 1080 resolution we are getting square blocks screen.(display is not smooth in high resolution) No stereo sound...."
438,4,Wonderful,"Tv is good and price worthy but brightness very high,sound quality is not so good as expected. Installation is also done successfully but little bit cross fitted by company person. Ok will see the tv durability."
439,5,Simply awesome,"Absolutely Buck TV.  First of all I want to state that I ordered the TV on 14th June, Delivered on 16 th June and finally got installed on 17june. Thanks to Flipkart for Faster delivery and installation.  Review ing after 2 days of usage would post and update further on the due course of my usage.  Wifi connectivity is smooth even with mobile hotspot thanks to inbuilt data saver. Connectivity is absolutely fine with remote, HDMI,wifi. Prime, Netflix, YouTube,Zee5 works butterfly smooth even with mobile hotspot. No buffering at low internet speed as well,which I liked the most out of it. Casting also works fine, just downloaded Google Home and it's working fine. Remote has Alexa works from all directions.  Sound - Sound is fine with its inbuild 20watt speaker, it is sufficient for a hall. It has a option of connecting home theatre or other sound system as it provides inbuild HDMI Arc, head phone output, and Bluetooth.  Picture- Picture quantity is decent but not comparable with Sony or Samsung FHD and at 17k it is quite a buck Tv with all the features."
440,4,Pretty good,Picture quality is ok for this price but not so good better go for a 43 inch of this model if you need a good picture quality OS is very user friendly and the best Sound quality is better The remote is very compact as it comes with bluetooth its very easy to handle as we can use it without pointing towards the tv Wifi and bluetooth connectivity are also available I check with mobile hotspot and my bluetooth headphone they are working good Don't worry about installation its an easy processi we can do it manually although they are providing it for free Don't expect for a price drop this price is fixed for a long time I suggest you to better go for a 43 inch tv of this model as the tv lacks in displaying a perfect picture quality It supports only 720p resolution The 43 inch model of this tv supports 1080p resolution The build quality is perfect I'm satisfied Don't think a lot this is the best tv for this price
441,5,Simply awesome,"Wonderful product for an affordable price. Superb picture quality. Good sound, connectivity and features. Great value for money."
442,5,Great product,"Good connection, tv is very light weights. Good quality screen, superb sound, installation very fast, middle class family better choose,👌👌"
443,4,Pretty good,"Tv is good best budget tv and picture quality is good, head phone out available, internet works fine, if anyone in budget and needs a better led so go for it,"
444,4,Pretty good,"TV is good, sound is clear and adequate loud, picture quality is not as good as I was expecting but for 11k it's absolutely fine. I have no complaint about it for this price. The delivery and installation was done on scheduled time. I had a wall mount of sony 32 inch tv and I got it installed on the same (didn't brought Mi stand). It has wifi, bluetooth and all connectivity options after installing a update of around 850 MB. You will get both (Chromecast & Miracast) once you update it to latest version. Don't forget to buy 3 year complete protection if you are buying this TV."
445,3,Does the job,"Good android tv, got it @10799 But this is 3star power tv, actually this is not power saving  Netflix and prime video included  I installed hot star and Sony LIV app and if you don't want to buy set top box then android tv is the best,  For those who are not watching regular tv Just recharg hotstar and Sony LIV app with premium  You definately not go for set top box"
446,4,Really Nice,"Good tv with great versatility but the picture quality is not good,average contrast and average brightness . But great size under 25k with lots of features. After installing the android 9 update ,the tv was slow and I faced many problems regarding wifi and connectivity. Also my tv does not support usb card reader and usb gamepad as well. Good service via flipkart."
447,4,Nice product,This MI 4a Pro Lead smart Android Tv good product picture and sound quality is very good. But the installation technician is not have enough knowledge about this product. He i.e the technician is doesnot have knowledge in all features. Of this product. Finally i am not satisfy the installation of this product
448,4,Pretty good,It is no way less than any other smart TV of leading brands. We can say that it is better because it has full fledged android experience with Google Play Store.   I deduct one star because it becomes in functional while update of operating system for long period of time. It is better to have dumb tv with Apple TV/Fire Tv or Mi Tv box. At least one can enjoy set top box tv channels while games/software is installing or updating in progress.
449,5,Simply awesome,"Best in quality, the picture quality is also good sound is also really high, but willing doing casting you required google home app in your mobile, you can not directly cast your mobile. Other then thta everything is superb."
450,3,Just okay,"If you need a big screen TV in budget so it is for you Sound is so so But connectivity is so bad If you want to connect your mobile with TV so it's not support mirror screen it's support Chromecast in which you can see only online or Google application and you Know how 4G work in our country 😜 So it's major problem if network is baad in your Area and also I try to connect my mobile with USB cable but it's support it, so I need USB to HDMI cable then it's show on my TV that's it"
451,5,Highly recommended,"Very good product for its price. Gives its competitor a run for their money by providing many features. Patchwall is great. Groups the content very well. Im not going to complain about the picture quality.. lets say its decent at this price. Sound levels are okay for a small room. Overall, a great tv for people who are looking to buy a good tv with budget constraint. Go for it"
452,4,Value-for-money,"I expected too much but worth of money ok, wall mounted pay extra money, and picture quality sound quality I expect more ok, and compare with Sony smart led 32"" best review this product so only I purchased but no equal to sony"
453,4,Nice product,this mi led smart TV is superb the pic quality is good and connectivity feature are good to work as well as sound is great I'm so satisfying with the led tv and im most thankfully for flipkart because the installation service is good and free of cost thank you flipkart
454,5,Awesome,"overall my purchase was good , d date given to me for delivering the product was exact and the service engineer also came the same day ...overall installation was good they charged extra 400 for wall mount but ys it was mentioned by them earlier.... picture quality is average of u don't have hd channels but still it is a great buy ...it cost me 13k as i also took some extra service from Flipkart which cost me 1k ...overall good product"
455,2,Expected a better product,you need TV remote every time to switch on the tv.  you can't control from single remote (set top box remote)  5years old Samsung LED TV picture quality is better than this MI tv.  no spdif (fiber) port for home theater.
456,5,Simply awesome,"THIS TV is Best on HD set top BOX , On Normal Set top Box buy Led HD ready Product  This is Very Beautiful Product and OnHD the clarity is good"
457,5,Perfect product!,"Great TV with lots of features. It has built in Chrome cast feature which means u dnt have to bother about ur phone, just share and lock the phn..it will do the rest by its own...The remote has dedicated Netflix and prime video buttons, with a built in mic and dedicated google assistant key. Thanks MI for this spontaneous improvement to your products..."
458,3,Does the job,considering the price & feature compare to other brand it's best brand.but if some one already using samsung or Sony tv than he will easily differentiat the display quality.considering price it's good but not good those want full hd experience .
459,4,Really Nice,"Nothing can beat it in terms of price. you can not get a flagship smartphone in 23k but you can get a TV with really good picture quality and sound. i have connected my pc with the TV and i enjoy playing Games like Star Wars : Jedi Fallen Order or Borderlands 3 on a 43"" display. and it now supports Netflix ❤"
460,5,Super!,"Wow, Full to Cinematic surrounding sound experience. Great LED tv in budget price.. with pure android experience, great Picture quality pls use HD Channels for better TV Viewing experience.. Good JOB by MI Corporation..Thanks MI"
461,4,Wonderful,# 8 months after review # MI tv features are quite impressive but it takes 20 to 30 sec to boot up. and this is really frustrating everytime time you start tv you need to wait 30 sec to wait for actually screen. I need to add 1 of the valuable point is dont look out for android based tv in low price range because yet it is not successful. you will feel major lag out while running applications ..better way is that just go for smart tv like samsung and LG which takes hardly 2 sec to start after switch on plug.
462,5,Great product,"1. Picture quality is awesome with this price 2. Sound is Great 3. WiFi direct is not available, We can use Mirror screen via Google Home Application and Gallery Acess via All Screen Application (Internet access required to intial connect), 4. Bluetooth is working well, i have connected my JBL Headset and its fine 5. We Can use 4 GB of Internal memory only out of 8GB 6. Default video player is not supported for all audio format, So we need to install VLC Player or KODI player which is working too good Totally worth for money, no issues found yet"
463,5,One of the best in this range.,"I have been using the TV for almost 3 months and I think I can give a fair review now. I got it for 8900 rupees after discounts.  Pros: 1. Casting is easy. You can simply connect it to your mobile hotspot and the cast screen or cast youtube. 2. YouTube is pre installed so you can login to your google account and start watching. (or use without logging in, your wish) 3. Sound is decent. It isn't too much to replace your speakers, but it is more than enough in a room or even a small hall. 20W is enough for a large room/small hall. 4. If you want more sound, you can always connect the bluetooth speakers or normal speakers with aux cable. 5. You can use the normal TV remote or download any android TV remote app from google playstore and use it. 6. Connecting a laptop via HDMI cable is also very easy and I often do that. You can also use a pendrive for that.  Cons: 1. You cannot use too many apps in the TV. After installing Netflix, Prime Video, Hotstar etc, if you still want to add few more apps, the loading will become slower and casting will also not work properly. 2. You won't get Netflix/Prime pre-installed in it. There's an update approx 900MB in size which includes the apps. You need to install it to use those apps.  Any further pros/cons I figure out while using the TV, I will update my review with them. Hope it helped."
464,5,Awesome,"amazing, I m enjoying it, I paid 11500 for mi led smart tv. value for money. I will give 100/100."

476,4,Very Good,"Total Value for Money! You will not regret buying this tv. Its a very good product from MI. Built quality is good, feela premium. It will not be fair to compare picture quality of this tv with other brands like Sony, LG etc. Better then VU and other similar price range products available in the market. Pure android experience with option for patch wall software. Very well designed minimilist bluetooth remote with google voice search integrated neatly. Overall i would say good experience."
477,4,Wonderful,"Well you will find many details in other reviews negative/positive both. Here I will say it's must buyable product with this cost. Everything is available connectivity, casting, internet, Android apps. Picture quality is not upto the mark but it's fine. Sound is usual compare to other TVs.. Mom is very happy and using much as android mobile.."
478,4,Value-for-money,it's very good product. Picture quality sound quality superb lil connectivity issue is there. but it's ok. one thing need to say company is providing only and only software or internal warranty not physical warranty. even most used thing with this TV is remote for this product also company is not providing warranty. so be careful while using it. enjoy Mi TV
479,5,Terrific purchase,Fantastic price and fantastic size and fantastic device.  One complain that the ram is bit low for fast processing and sometimes it take a lot of time in switching operations
480,5,Highly recommended,very good flipkart service and many help and support to me very good MI product value for the money thank you FLIPKART. AND Mi

485,3,Does the job,tv and flipkart delevery is good and very simple but installation and demo very bed experience jeeves consumer not good servece not good demo and not own convince time they was installation...
486,5,Classy product,"purchased this mi TV in big billion day. @8949 only.  product get deliver on time.  pros:  1) it is a Android TV so here you can connect the tv through internet and watch YouTube, Netflix.. etc.  2) apart of that there is two interface provided by the tv one is patch wall and second is Android you can switch between two easily by a single click.  3) able to use mouse.  4) there is 8gb of internal memory that you can utilize to download app from play store. I did not tried yet.  5) There is three hdmi port.   cons: this product does not contain wall mounting kit and while installlation jeeva people ask for 1600.  installation of this tv is very easy. I did from my own.  if any plan for wallmouting please purchase separate and when people come for installation then you can tell them to walk mount.  if these comments are helping you then please like the comment."
487,4,Really Nice,"Good picture and sound quality , Easy wireless connectivity, Multiple HDMI, Easy Mirroring  But should provide the wall support stand and screws compatible for each model. Also battery is not provided for Mi Remote.  Very good experience with TV installation and demo"
488,4,Wonderful,"nice decent smart tv .picture are sharp and bright and connectivity to wifi ,Bluetooth is quick...except to HDMI to home theatre ..need to do some setting in tv to connect HDMI ARC output to home theater speaker... sound is bit disappointed ...NO Dolby coded in TV only DTS codec available so won't get full enjoyment of sound in action movies . over all good stuff is cheap price. Recommend extended warranty for 2 year by third party."
489,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"Good quality device. delivery and installation will be done as much as possible fast ... Installation processing technicians will be done work very fastly, once again thank you flipkart.. connectivity related issue is occur screen mirroring option is not working properly"
490,4,Worth the money,nice product but ram prosessor needs to be increased to 2gb . nice picture and average sound quality . prime video works only if we have updated software . overall nice product for its price range
491,5,Best in the market!,so happy with this TV.. brought this product for 9999 and picture is very nice sounds nice fast delivery. fast installation.
492,1,Did not meet expectations,Everything is good and I like the TV. I purchase this led tv for his Google Chromecast feature and google assistance. It's make some trouble when we connect Tv to mobile. Sometime it's show and sometime it's not show in mobile. Otherwise all is good. Sound quality and picture quality is more better than Samsung led.
493,5,Super!,Amazing TV amazing features best clarity amazing sound quality out of 5 stars
494,5,Awesome,"Awesome Smart TV for a very affordable price range. Sound Quality, Android Functionality, Picture Quality is Good but for this price range it's Superb👍👍👍"

497,4,Pretty good,"best buy , I have got it in only 9999 , this is great offer , having good picture and sound quality"
498,4,Good choice,value for money best display panel at this price range good and clear audio quality and youtube works pretty fine it can play video at 1080ppi...mi is doing pretty good job i can say that panel is equally good as sony and samsung at this price range...if you have a budget of 14000 then definetly go for this model....
499,5,Mind-blowing purchase,good tv at this price picture quality is very good and sound awesomi like this tv one day use is very good value of money good tv
500,4,Really Nice,tv is awesome and best in this price. but installation service is not good. we received TV on 2nd October and today is 6th but no one comes for the installation. they promise that installation will be done on 3rd October.
501,5,Simply awesome,Super Quality of Picture. I Recommend for High Quality Picture Lovers. Looking for Best Smart TV under 12K then go for it.
502,4,Very Good,"I have got it in Rs 8448/- & its a good price but Chromecast is not working, I have tried more than 20 times but no result. After contacting customer care, he said to download MI HOME app & connect with TV through same WI-FI ntwrk means you can't connect it with your mobile NTWRK , you have to connect ur mobile & TV with a third device WI-FI .Let's try....sound quality is fantastic. Screen casting sud be easy bcoz if u hv one mobile den u can't screen cast."
503,4,Very Good,"Value for money .. good product 3 years of warranty covered with the additional payment of rupees 1100 ... dont think too much just go for it ... awesome product, we can use this television like our mobile phone ..."
504,5,Worth every penny,"Its worth for money ,cheap and best. sound quality is very super .I like it, THANK Flipkart service."

506,5,Must buy!,mi led tv is good and led tv equality is awesome it's good and Flipkart delivery is fast
507,5,Brilliant,excellent product and service is very good and timely delivered and installed from Flipkart so trusted by Flipkart
508,5,Brilliant,Amazing tv 1. I am impressed tv sound quality very nice sound quality in this tv😎 2. And more features in this tv are u can connect easily with phone and mirror casting option there 3. Totally best smart tv in this budget 👍
509,5,Mind-blowing purchase,Excellent product but Jio tv and Browser neither given nor available in Google play store for install. Google Chromecast is amazing and Mi tv can be paired with bluetooth audio system. Superb picture and sound quality Mi remote with voice typing facility is another best feature in this tv. Value of money...
510,5,Terrific,"I would like to suggest this product if someone is looking for a budget friendly Smart TV  Pros: 1. Image quality is good, 4k video display is impressive. 2. Sound quality is pretty decent, dont expect much woofer effects from TV speakers. 3. Inbuilt chrome cast is available with ease we can mirrore mobile video to TV. Cons: 1. Switching between apps wont be that fast. Gradually this issue is resolving over new software updates. 2. Sometimes video will get struck and need to switch off and on TV"
511,1,Not recommended at all,"It is an android tv but doesn't support the most important apps like Netflix and Prime, So no point in buying without this content provider being supported, I could see other tv brands below this price range are providing this basic features and also once you buy the tv you can not open it immediately, you need to wait for the installation and I waited for a week for it. I would say it is basic tv."
512,4,Worth the money,"Good Picture & Sound quality. Great viewing angles. Android TV & Chromecast works excellent & adds whole new way of using Television. Software is fast, though it lags during the first 5 mins after turning on the TV. Can sideload almost all the Android apps. Official Play store have very limited numbers of Apps & Games. Patchwall is super fast and agile. Better then Android TV in terms of speed. Overall it is the must have SMART TV to buy because it offers way to much in the name of Android Tv compared to other non-android SmartTVs. Hope all the streaming services like Netflix & Prime Video soon launch their official apps. Although Chromecast works fine meanwhile."
513,4,Delightful,"Writing review after using it for 10 days. Everything looks fine in this price range. For best picture quality use HDMI cable for connecting STB. You need to configure the color setting. Sound quality is not as good as Sony. Lacking Picture sharpness but good in this range. On connecting to any Bluetooth speaker, volume decreases. during installation it took too much time micast my mobile but finally done. Wall mount device and HDMI cable should must be provided by Mi, as others are providing in same or less price. After all Flipkart has provided on time delivery and installation. You can go for this if u want to spend some less money."
514,5,Terrific purchase,"First of all, the best service by flipkart as always. Got the delivery and installation at exactly same time when I asked for. 5 out of 5 for flipkart and it's services. The product it self is really nice as expected. Totally value for money. using for nearly 2½ month with no issue. Great picture quality as per the price. Well connectivity. I'm using bluetooth home theater and I don't have any issue about lagging or delay in sound. User friendly interface. And minimalistic design of the tv and the the remote is so cool and cute to. I recommend this product with out any doubt. Thank you Flipkart...!"
515,5,Best in the market!,"Picture quality- is above than i expected, played 4k video its beauty. Sound quality- is also very good, its 20 watt speaker Connectivity- is also very smoothe Android interface- is fair enough, sometimes it feels laging.. but overall very good deal. i give 4.5/5 money well spent💰"
516,4,Wonderful,best range Android smart tv up to this range... . but i have a 1 problem.... its humble request to mi plz do some work in Bluetooth connectivity of this product.. connectivity between Bluetooth and phone very very poor.... thank you mi....
517,4,Wonderful,Display is very good beyond expectation... Worth every penny & no regrets... No issues with connectivity... Google assistant works great and fast. Advisable to buy this product in this price range...
518,5,Awesome,Picture quality is good Service was a great Price low Super android tv thank u flipkart Good service Over all good
519,4,Delightful,Tv is really good. Picture and Sound quality is awesome. Good resolution with normal dth set top box. Also watched 4k videos by internet. It plays 4k videos also. Running very good all videos above 720p. It is value for money. But installtion done by one week late. Worst experience of flipkart in installation service. Otherwise Tv is good.
520,4,Very Good,"after first update of 750 mb it got few improvement, which make it a better and excellence in every way.. ie. 1. no need to navigate to hdmi ports or tv.. it simply go to previous connected port.. 2.it gives a screen off button for quick on and off, like a power button on a smart phone.. 3. connectivity becom smooth, can be play song movie picture directly from your phone(on google apps) .. 4. mirror mobile is also a good experience by google HOME app.. 5. after some settings image quality got really good..."
521,5,Wonderful,Picture & Sound quality is amazing for this price segment.  Note: If you want wall mount they charge Rs.499/- I had done the same. Disappointed with the alignment as after paying 499/- the mount appears a little crooked which I had informed at the same time to the technician but he just adjusted by tilting it by hand.  Would appreciate if they could rectify the same after reading the review. Thank you.
522,3,Good in this price range,"Display quality not so good. Wifi is OK, working properly. Sound quality is perfect. Although there is google voice assistant but that doesn't work with all apps available there, only work with youtube. Apps are limited there, just a few. Installation was done 4 days after delivered. He really wasn't much interested who came to install, came quick gone quick. Overall i won't say it was bad buy, product is good under this price."
523,5,Terrific,"5star only for installation guy... the boy is very sincere..  Picture:- picture display is ok ok. when connect to Wi-Fi and play any full hd resolution vdo, the picture quality is superb.  Sound:- output by Aux/Bluetooth The audio chip in this LED is third class.. lowest sound output from both function -aux & bluetooth even when you have a boom-blastic tower speakers my ex led had best sound output and it have only 25% of that  Sound:- LED speaker audio output from LeD speakers is very nice..  Connectivity:- connectivity is good till now... my Asus mobile connect fast  I choose this one for only Bluetooth option for my Bluetooth tower speaker (200w) bt nothing get from this led...  will update after some days of use"
524,5,Excellent,"Very nice tv in range . Android tv takes 10 sec to start but it's ok. It support keyboard (but shortcut keys don't work)and mouse(I am using hp keyboard and mouse,You can use your favorite). It connects very well to wifi . You can install google crome with app backup and use it as pc for browsing.(If you want best sound experience then add small home theater coz it don't give bass in internal speakers) Overall it's a best choice"
525,4,Value-for-money,good tv at this price includes all feature are working very nice. value of money is not enough to say it's awesome product at this range.
526,4,Very Good,At this range u can't afford anything more than it.....  PICTURE- HD channels have very good picture quality.....but when it comes to viewing sd channels the quality sucks....   Sound is good as well.....but for a cinematic experience I would recommend to connect it with a MI soundbar.....  only concern is Bluetooth connectivity.....when u connect a speaker via Bluetooth the voice synchronization doesn't hold well....which means audio comes early wrt video....
527,5,Must buy!,Highly Recommend - Value for Money  Overall 4/5 I would rate. better picture quality. Audio system could have been better but definitely above average.  not much lag in connectivity and UI is very smooth & User friendly. All the features works without any issue.
528,4,Very Good,thank u MI u r best Friend for ever and Flipkart for time to time best service thank u so much
529,5,Brilliant,Fast delivery super fast installation within 3 hrs ! excellent job hats off to Flipkart . Mi 4A pro picture quality is Amazing don't miss it !
530,5,Worth every penny,The tv is good. looks also good. all the features are working fine. one thing I want to say if you buying led tv then upgrade your set top box with hd otherwise you can't able to enjoy its celarity. thanks mi..... and flipkart also
531,5,Mind-blowing purchase,An excellent product by MI worth for money..Thnks Flipkart for fast shipping and installation of the Tv through Jeeves and at last thanks for Jeeves for timely installation and wall mounting..
532,5,Just wow!,"Very smart TV and I am very happy, quality best and clean pictures and sound best and all the perfect TV.. Thanks"
533,1,Not recommended at all,Screen Mirroring is not ok. It play through app links like as internet browsing on tv. it only collects links via mobile through the apps supported in tv nothing else. while Samsung not require to connect with internet and works on screen mirroring with all our local media files and photos etc.
534,5,Simply awesome,"Installation successfully. Everything is fantastic. I love the TV . This is the best TV I have ever seen in this budget. sometimes casting not connect in 1st attempt, then you will have to restart your phone & It will connect smoothly via Google Home app with phone hotspot. thanks alot FLÏPKÃRT team."
535,1,Don't waste your money,"This is worth with this price but Im not much satisfied due to performance of the tv. Sometimes the tv is restarting when we teying to connect other wifi network. Also if you switched on your tv then you need to wait for 2 to 3 mins to open, its like a mobile device. But in my view tv should be switched on when we turn on the tv, we should not wait for more than 3 mins to see the picture. Wifi network is not refreshing if we turn any new wifi device. Screen mirroring is very worst, playing like a buffering videos. So worth for this money. If you compromise the aforesaid issues, llease go ahead with this. Thanks"
536,5,Brilliant,Really TV is awesome pictures quality good sound is more than enough connectivity is also good but need to download all the apps to watch patchwall
537,4,Nice product,Best value for money but this is hd ready tv... this is not support 720p Video format...  Installation Guy Was Very Good Man...Avdhesh Bhai...Thanks
538,5,Excellent,"Good TV Worth its price. True theatrical experience, The one's saying casting problem is that only direct casting is not available you have to connect to the hotspot of your mobile and the app to be casted should support casting too eg:- Hotstar . Very good behaviour from the installation executive and fast, free and convenient (time and date) installation. Good to play games too high end graphics and only con I experienced was all apps are not available at play store. But fully satisfied"
539,5,Worth every penny,"Simply awesome, yes.. you get feature rich Android TV, voice control and super clarity picture and sound is also great. would recommend this TV above all the other hyped brands. It's worth more than I bargained for at this price.."
540,5,Brilliant,"A very honest review This TV is superb in such price Fully android Works very well on mobile hotspot Hotstar and mason prime is preinstalled Clarity is mind blowing Sound quality is OK System Update comes for about 1 year and security updates comes every year Patch wall is very unique to use It is best compare to Samsung , LG,realme."
541,1,Utterly Disappointed,"satisfied with the product , overall a good experience at this price . obviously there will a difference if you spend more however for price conscious person it's absolutely great TV with all lastest features. though you can't compare it with brands like Sony and all"
542,4,Nice product,Flipkart delivery is very prompt also the technician came next-day of delivery and demonstration also very nice  picture quality is good sound is very good.  worth for the money
543,5,Excellent,This has been an amazing experience right from placing the order till the complete installation and demo of Mi Smart TV. The TV is worth the money and it simply provides you amazing features at this price point. You should really go with this TV if you are looking for one.  Thanks a lot Flipkart for providing this amazing and wonderful experience.
544,1,Terrible product,this TV is a like a normal led TV and not a smart TV. No app is running smoothly. there is a lot of hanging and connectivity issues in almost all the apps. My other iffalcon smart led TV is running smoothly on the same WiFi network. so just a normal TV for me nothing smart in it. flipkart please return or refund this product. A horrible experience this time with flipkart
545,1,Don't waste your money,"Worth of money. Best in this price. Video quality is quite good, as par with brands like Lg, thomson, onida etc but nt compareable with sony or samsung. Default sound is nt dat good but with change in settings nice sound. Connectivity is superb with built in chromecast. Amazon prime and netflix have to be installed using pen drive. Overall grt experience."
546,1,Absolute rubbish!,"I ordered the tv on oct 14th and got the product on 31st october, and that too after making 6 enquiry calls and 1 visit to the satellite hub in my town. Only when i visited the hub i came to know that there was some issue with the barcode. The product worked good for just few days and then started to get switch off automatically. When i requested for replacement on the 9th day from the day of delivery, they refused to replace and was saying that only repair is possible. I had to make another 3-4 calls to make the replacement happen. Apart from this, i also purchased a skirt and 3 tops out of which all were of poor quality. In short i just want to say that providing customers with damaged and low quality products during sale on offer is not suitable for a reputed online shopping site like Flipkat. So please keep up your standards."
547,4,bang for the buck...,"I was initially doubtful about the quality of the product.. but it was above my expectation, Picture quality is good, Sound got better after updating it with patch, there were connectivity issues with miracast, however got cleared with software updation. Youtube, netflix, prime and hotstar runs smoothly.. To my surprise I could play some of 4k videos without lags..It come with VA panel.. IPS could have been better, however doesnot majorly affect the side views.. Google assistant works like breeze..Its worth the money...Just go for this.."
548,4,Worth the money,"Good product but slow to boot. You can't expect a TV to boot like a TAB or Phone. May be this is the way android TV works, but i wished it to be fast on boot. Good picture quality and sound is impressive. The installation person was very professional and well mannered. Its really good to see such better persons on installation front."
549,4,Really Nice,"It will be a perfect tv ..if it will come with miracast and with good connectivity ...my old kodak tv connectivity was very good If i scale my both tv than ... MY OLD KODAK ANDROID TV. 9/10 MI Tv 6/10 No miracast ..poor wifi signal ,everytime pending download , No prime video app (available but most of features not available on this tv), no blutooth music , no mouse cursor switch."
550,5,Terrific,"Mi LED Smart 4A Pro is an outstanding product. There's no doubt, this is the best you can get in this price range. I don't know about others but I feel the USB port should be in a better position. I have to struggle to insert my pen drive at the back of this device."
551,4,Good choice,"Value of money, connectivity taking little long time, booting is slow, bloothuth connections are awsome sutting down is taking time. correct time delivery and installation was good almost was good experience."
552,4,Worth the money,"Fully satisfied with ""Android TV"" and its overall quality. (After 4 month of use).  Pros: 1. Good screen quality. Slim and low weight. 2. Clear sound. 3. Specially, simple user interface design. Easy to handle with anyone. 4. Excellent remote control and its design. 5. Play store access is very beneficial.  Cons: 1. Screen mirroring with mobile phone is sometimes having bit complicated to connect. 2. If we watch HD quality movies through pen-drive, it will stuck after playing sometime (between 20-30 mins).  Any way, go ahead who love a smart TV with low budget."
553,5,Perfect product!,"wonderful, very impressive , better performance, high clarity, better sound quality , happy with mi tv.... must buy and enjoy.."
554,4,Pretty good,I bought this TV in big billon days.. it's really worth for money. I got this TV before delivery date and installation also gave before the expected date.. but installation person not gave demo properly.. I really felt very happy to order from Flipkart.. but please give the proper demo.. otherwise everything is good..
555,1,Terrible product,"Voice is pretty poor on Hdmi worst tv i've ever brought plz dont buy mi tv, its so complicated and not at all user friendly a new user will find a laptop much more easier to handle and underatnd than this tv. even the technician who came to sort the problem said he cant do anything, this tv brand doenst have great voice, need to up the volume to 70% to hear voice clearly no wonder they sell this tvs for such cheap, did a big mistake ac3 format doesnt play on this tv, u cant change the sound mode or pic mode while playing a movie thru a pendrive, need to go back, back and back forever why cant they give a normal user friendly remote you cant even play the next video while a watching the current one, coz they skipped all the buttons, u need to go back and then play the next. voice is biggest problem is this tv, plz dont go for it, i made a mistake, hope others dont"
556,1,Terrible product,"The sound quality is really bad. I found and followed many tutorials and forums describing how to tune the sound for Mi TVs, but even then the sound quality remained bad. Lot of forums suggested to use external speakers however, they also describe that the TV is compatible or works better only with specific speakers. Some also suggest the bad sound quality is because it has speakers under the TV, and works better when placed it on a table instead of hanging on the wall. Not happy at all with the purchase."
557,3,Fair,BEST LED IN THIS PRICE. FAST DELIVERY WITH NEXT DAY INSTALATION. Best Android TV
558,1,Terrible product,The Mr.Perfect Tv  Everything was superb every spec in Tv is fabulous.Picture quality is so good youtube at 1080p is perfectly playing.Sound was clear and loud enough and android operating system is so good and in-built chromecast was good enough to cast.Delivery and installation was done in the same day.
559,5,Brilliant,"Very good smart TV. I got it in 10800 with ICICI bank offer of extra off. Display good , sound loud & clear. Connectivity good. Still i didnt connected using chromecast, will edit my review after 15/20 days of use. This review is after using for 1 day."
560,5,Perfect product!,Best LED for buying best prize and the LED is awesome 🐱
561,4,Really Nice,"Everything is good and I really loved this product. Value for Money...(after using 1 months)  Few suggestions: (reason for 4 ratings) You may need adjust sound / pictures settings for better quality. You need VLC player to be installed for all the audio format support. External Speakers sound is bit low compared to Laptop , but need some adjustments in TV settings. Connectivity is very good , using Airtel 4g hotspot,  Everytime it needs to be switched on explicitly from remote / TV button. Flexible wall mount is high costly, since they are not offering it for free like in VU. (1700rs) Overall it's excellent/ awesome with this price and good for small room."
562,3,Fair,"Not as per the expection. People are buying only MI tv ,I thought it is very good ,but in comparison to BPL and Micromax whic I am using right now.I felt Mi is not better than my other TV. its good but not that good."
563,3,Nice,"Doesn't support all android app pdf reader , WhatsApp , mail box and many app not support but kodack smart tv many android phone app support"
564,4,Good choice,At this price point tv is superb but patchwall software of this tv is laggy android is superb and also connectivity is superb but google assistant not work properly at some time remote quality of this tv is decent and the remote is made in china remote connectivity is good big problem in this tv is cast cast is not work properly in non supported miracast device and also flipkart delivery person is very bad installation person is good behavior thankyou so much
565,5,Classy product,"I'm using it from last 10 months It was very pretty at reasonable and affordable price I bough it for Rs.12,424 only I hope it will come for 10 more years"
566,5,Excellent,"I have recently purchased this Mi TV 4A Pro 32 inch from flipkart. The quality is very good, it look and feel very premium in hand.

568,5,Fabulous!,"Perfect TV in affordable price, i just Love MI TV and other products as well ♥️✌️"
569,4,Good quality product,"there are many negative reviews about connectivity and i was also doubtfull about its connectivity but xiaomi has done a good job after giving updates to the Tv and we don't have to reconnect it again and again,picture quality is best in this price range,one have to choose the mode which they like according to their eye adjustments and sound also has many modes which you can prefer according to your need.If one has to cast something from mobile and don't have a wifi connection but have a xiaomi mobile,they can simply use miracast and you can cast your mobile without using your mobile internet also."
570,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"It's been a month that I have used this TV..Picture quality is nice..Sound is awesome and doesn't distort even when u put it to the highest decibels.. Connectivity is pretty smooth..GoogleTalk works like a charm.. Definitely 5 stars for this cost!! Few things I would love to see though.. There should be more options to customise your viewing experience..Like colour ratio etc.. And yes, NOT having a mute button on your remote is a major drawback...THERE HAS TO BE A MUTE BUTTON..."
571,5,Must buy!,"Product it good. I am posting my review after using product for morr than 3 months. Quality is good and it works as good as other smart tv works. Picture quality is also good. At the price range which is cheaper even mobile phones, it's worth buying. Fully satisfied"
572,5,Mind-blowing purchase,Everything is too good fine Picture quality is superb with this amount money And connectivity is good if u know how to use in a better way..
573,5,Classy product,Writing review after using four consecutive days: 1. Value for money 2. Timely and safely delivered by Flipkart 3. Installed in due date and time. 4. Picture clarity is beyond my words 5. Sound is at it's best 6. Wifi connectivity is too good 7. No buffering during connected on wifi 8. I am fully satisfied with Mi & Flipkart.

577,4,Really Nice,"Thanks for timely delivery. Overall the tv is very good...I would just like to tell that I'm not happy as far as installation is concern. Installation person have not used proper wallmount stand for 40 inch..it was small. And after insisting few times they install the stand required for 40 inch tv, otherwise they were going to use small stand. Demo was not properly given, they don't have proper knowledge. So I request flipkart to arrange for proper demo."
578,5,Worth every penny,"I wanted to gift MI Smart TV to my mom,so my friend Anu suggest me to buy Ml 4A Pro, this Smart TV have lots of features, Very affordable price & the best part of this TV is full HD, Wi-Fi & Bluetooth Connectivity . I am thankful to Flipkart for providing me installation in same day 😄😄 If you are planning to buy a smart tv must take MI 4A PRO👍"
579,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"Picture quality is just awesome fabulous but its tough to connect with your mobile offline, you will be able to connect your mobile only over internet with google home. No screen mirroring no smart screen works."
580,5,Great product,Great picture quality and pretty good Sound. A total value for money. The Patchwall 3.0 is very nice and easy to access. Totally satisfied with the product.
581,5,Best in the market!,Everything is good. I m Happy with the product. But i was expected sound quality much better apt from tat evething is v good
582,4,Delightful,I got this for 11870 including the 3 years additional support. For this price point this smart TV is value for money. The screen is some what not impressive for OLED but apart from this the sound output is good. The wifi don't support 5Ghz band. The remote works fine. Overall the TV is an excellent buy.
583,5,Super!,Good picture quality and sounds The best are mi remote in voice control And good good good
584,5,Awesome,"After the one week viewing I am writing . with in three days delivered, installation also good with covid precautions, installation person taken excellent care, T V. excellent picture and sound quality.

586,5,Great product,good Fantastic installation is also done good thanks for the On time Delivery ... Budget offer + happy TV
587,5,Highly recommended,"Mi Tv: I always had a bad feeling regarding mi. In terms of quality of product. But this one is worth for the money I paid. I am not exaggerating it. It s worth. Then in terms of audio, video everything is fine till now. Its been 2 months. One thing I didn't like is 1gb ram. They can increase it to 2.but its OK for tv. I am satisfied with this thank you"
588,4,Worth the money,Excellent Product Complete Value for money.Amazing Sound Quality and Patchwall Of Mi Is Too Good And About Cons I can say that that Storage is less ie 8 gb of which 4gb is only available and other is that its Usb port is Other than that Tv is back side and not suitable when its it is mounted. Other than it is very worth product and everybody who want should but it..
589,5,More than my expectation. MI TV 4A PRO 32 inch is awesome.,"Thank you MI and Flipkart, for what i received is worthable product for money from MI and ontime delivery as ensured by Flipkart in a well good manner. MI TV 4A PRO is really good in picture quality and in sound quality as well, it has two speakers provided below the TV. I have not expected this much sound quality, but got more than my expectation. This TV made our home a special attraction. We have more options with this Android Smart TV. After using for a whole day and completely checked with trained professional Engineer, im writing this review where you can buy this TV in this good budget and it will make happiness in your home.  Thanks to Flipkart once again!"
590,5,Must buy!,"There is a prover that when end is well every thing is well. In all respects such as Flipkart, Ekart logistics, Jd Jeeves all deserved for 5stars. Really I am happy with this product and service . Thank you."
591,5,Awesome,Pros: 1. Excellent for its price. 2. Clarity at its peak for HD. 3. Casting options.   Cons: 1.Installation charges can be added with the same price. 2.Could improve TV thickness. 3. Sound system should be improved more particularly considering the hall.  Overall : Good to go for its price.
592,5,Terrific purchase,Very good led tv at 12k... Thnx MI... Safe and timely delever by flipkart.
593,5,Terrific purchase,Got it with in 2 days. Product is nice and design is also good. If u want to buy Mi product with 43 inch.this is the nice product in limited budget.  About installation Gaurav Gupta from team Jeeves is nice guy. He helped me to understand the Mi functions in a proper way.
594,4,Really Nice,"I am giving my review after 6 month use of product, very good product except sound quality. Sound is not that much good but ok as i have used sony tv which has good sound quality. But overall value for money product, u can buy it."
595,3,Does the job,Product is good bt installation engineer is not supported properly ( we installed tv one place bt that place not clear view. So again call service engineer bt still engineer not come to installation another place )
596,4,Delightful,Amazing product it is really value for money picture sound connectivity everything is better iam not uploading photos because lot of images about this product which is already in cart but installation is not good in way because they take lot of days it is better within 2-3 days complete the installation part  Thanks to Flipkart and thanks to mi
597,5,Wonderful,"Awesome buy! I am writing this review after 8 months of use. Picture quality is awesome,supports full hd. Sound quality crisp and clear. User friendly interface. Connectivity is good. No one can expect more features in this price."
598,5,Just wow!,"Great product . .I have been using it for more than 6 months now . .Netflix, prime, hotstar all built in . .good picture quality, good sound quality, great value for money"
599,5,Classy product,Good picture quality and excellent viewing angle. Screen panel is moderate quality but according to price range that is acceptable but mi should improve it little further. Need inbuild voltage stabilizer for voltage fluctuating condition.MI should provide it because you have to buy additional voltage stabilizer worth Rs 2000 which cost too much. That's why all the safety features and protection should get provided by MI for better experience. Remaining features such as sound and connectivity everything works pretty good.
600,5,Terrific purchase,"Awesome product, the sound and picture quality is good, Lot of good features like smartphone casting, voice remote, google assistant, etc with many apps and play store. Am seeing one issue where the video doesn't resume after any add pop-ups in sonyliv app. Cracked great deal during sale and got it for 10,749 only Always keep eyes on Flipkart sale, it's awesome"
601,4,Good quality product,Picture quality and smart technology is awesome for this price range. Instead of buying popular brand in high cost you can go for this 💯. Honestly saying good to buy.  Update: It's been almost two years since it is working good. Only facing problem while connecting chrome cast.
602,5,Super!,"It's a 720p resolution panel with good sound quality for a medium size room. Ofcourse it won't be as great as your Rs. 30K Branded TVs but it comes pretty close. Xiaomi has compromised at places which won't matter too much to you.  I bought it for my bedroom and it is capable enough to handle everything you throw at it. You get all your streaming apps.....the support for Netflix and Prime is quite good now.  As far as connectivity issues that many people have mentioned.....I haven't faced any yet. My wifi router is placed quite some distance away in another room but the TV catches the signals efficiently.  Installation was a breeze....I have to give props to the technicians.....even though lockdown was about to begin from next day because of corona, the technicians assured me of installation and came at 8:30 pm to install the TV on the same night as delivery"
603,4,Really Nice,"Awesome screen resolution, smart options. Best in the market at affordable price. Facing few issue in using Miracast. Not getting paired"
604,3,Fair,"Product is good and the installation was timely done. the cast feature does not work from my Moto G6. right after installation, the TV seeks an update of almost 900mb (though not mandatory). Some video formats, connected through USB are not supported in the TV."
605,5,Super!,"Very Nice Tv Everything Is Better Then Expected In This Budget,Overall Best Quality Tv, Writing This After Using For 2 Days, Connectivity Issus Was A Major Problem In Overall Reviews I Saw But I don't Had Any Kind Of Issue,You Can Buy This Tv Without Thinking, Promise Day Delivery Through Flipkart,Faster Installation..Thanks A Lot To Flipkart."
606,4,Delightful,I thought go to 25 k features it's not work properly . And not bad and not good ... One time investment I thought go for good product
607,4,Worth the money,Best android led tv best price I am so happy
608,5,Just wow!,"First i buy Micromax 32 inch smart tv, but sound quality of TV is very poor. I sold it and buy MI 32 incu TV, it is best LED tv sound and picture quality is grate."
609,5,Great product,Superb TV even at this price rate this is best also it has lots of features also the tv remote quite good functions with less buttons.
610,4,Good quality product,"TV is good for the price. We need to first have a good internet connection in order to buy any smart tv's. They function just like computers. Tv built , screen wide ratio , color clarity is good. Now my remote is not working. I'm using phone to operate the tv."
611,5,Highly recommended,"This Mi TV is The best product ever, i like it & enjoy the experience of mi products... 😘 😘"
612,5,Best in the market!,At this price range its really good product.. Connectivity is not so good but still remaining all features are awesome.. Sound and picture quality is nice.. Worth to buy
613,5,Simply awesome,"Brilliant TV, I would Say Smart TV as it provides many features, pocket friendly. Other thing that I found very highlighted about this TV is its Easy connectivity. Very Thin and light weight TV. Comes in good packaging."
614,5,Must buy!,Superb android television by Mi. Great connectivity features. Received the tv very safe and undamaged event at my native place. Anyone who is tight on budget and looking for a smart android tv must go for this ...
615,4,Pretty good,its Mi product so do not expect the quality of sony as for the same size sony cost for more than double of it... overall good product.. for person who can't afford sony its best option at value for money
616,5,Terrific purchase,I love flipcart service & good customers care service fast installation service. Good mi tv i love flipcart
617,5,Simply awesome,Same day my installation done I am vary happy ....and your service technician Salman shaikh his work done by very professionaly I am fully satisfied this person is very polite ...I am appreciate his work thanks Jeeves also and flip cart ..
618,2,Could be way better,"Very poor contrast and colour reproduction(colours lack vibrancy).. perennially shows a high backlit background.. Android OS has great features, but not yet well adapted for high media usage like TV.. laggy most times.. A much cheaper Non smart TV - Noble Skiodo has a superb display with vibrant colours"
619,5,Perfect product!,Wow wonderful nice product my love you redmi
620,4,Value-for-money,VERY GOOD SMART LED ITS WORTH IN SUCH A SMALL MONEY 👍👍
621,5,Wonderful,Very good product and very fast service... Thank you flipkart... I am really very happy... Super service delivery excellent...
622,5,Terrific purchase,"Very good product ! Delivery is very very perfect . so satisfy to buying this product , and thank you flipcart ❤"
623,4,Really Nice,The tv is very good but performance has issue. After 3/4 days you need to clean up memory. But it is good enough according money
624,5,Excellent,Nice smart MI LED TV good
625,5,Brilliant,"Mi LED Smart TV Picture Quality is very good. Sound is awesome, YouTube, Prime Video, Netflix, Hot Star all are connecting well with out lagging. This is very best and budget"
626,5,Best in the market!,"awesome product best in all range , all area rating 100% only soundwise 95%, it is a best product and delivery partner is too good"
627,2,Expected a better product,"Picture quality not good... It takes too much time to turning on as it's an android TV, good for watching steaming contents, I wish it has normal TV mode for set top box and smart tv mode for stream web content as it popup too many notificatios when we turn on the TV."
628,2,Slightly disappointed,It's have no basic features no smart features Just name smart tv I want to know what kind of smart tv no basic sample They have no option to farward backward next previous no sharing Only consume data of internet just for this have smart
629,5,Highly recommended,"Tv is best in its price range. Great picture quality decent sound. Normal casting of apps like YouTube, Netflix,Prime is no problem. But casting with Miracast is not working else fully satisfied ."
630,4,Wonderful,I am writing this review after couple of month of purchasing.. delivery was fast but gone through so many issues of delivery update. Instalation done at right time ...and overall experience is good but not best.. you can only see the good picture from the front side. neat working of Android but little slow.. nice finishing good brand. Happy with purchase..value for money..
631,5,Super!,"After searching a long time i got a excellent product by MI. Thanx to flipkart they delivered my smart led 40'' at right time and specially the installation is on same day too,that's really cool thing, technician install my led on wall with adjustable holder.(1500/-) a bit expensive. Picture quality is superb. Sound quality is too good. Connectivity a bit slow but it's fine for basic user's. Design is good. Overall this led tv is an awesome product, please go through without any hesitate. Even the customer support is to good."
632,5,Worth every penny,Very good product I recomend you to buy it is very good It will be better if u have a wifi connection Very good tv at this range Wifi is recomended!
633,5,Simply awesome,Tv is good in quality for first and lets see how it works after few months but this time it works properly. Right choice
634,3,Nice,few months ago I purchased same above tv but in 32 inch and i was very impressed. So again I purchased this one in 43 inches. It has upgraded version of Android from last one. But I feel connectivity is too slow. Most importantly chrome casting with google photos became more lengthy. In last version you have to connect your TV with your mobile with hot-spot and you go. but now you need an other Wi-Fi network to connect both devices and more to do.. I hope it will be fixed in near future so it became as easy it was..
635,5,Must buy!,"Awesome products, sound & picture quality very nice, and I am very happy useful this product. Thank you mi."
636,5,Wonderful,Just used it for couple of hours. Well performance is good just like any other smart TV.
637,5,Highly recommended,Excellent Tv . Amazing pic clarity and sound . Easy navigation and browsing . Just go for it 👍
638,5,Highly recommended,Good Product in this price range as well as very happy from jeeves team who is arrange earlier installation my TV at home one day advance upon my request appreciate it
639,4,Good quality product,Clarity is not that great . U have good features for modern usage. Sound is fine
640,5,Simply awesome,Excellent product in its price range. Video & Sound quality is good. Dolby digital sound effects & picture quality on HD channels are upto the mark. Connectivity is also good for online videos using apps supporting chromecast but sometimes local videos/photos cannot be viewed in big screen due to chromecast issues which I suspect is due to the Android version incompatibility of the mobile phone & TV. When I chromecasted from Google photos it was working fine then suddenly after using for sometime it started giving an error and I had to individually cast each photo. videos from my local folder were not casting. Overall it's a great product in its price range with preinstalled apps & user friendly interface. Was a good experience.
641,4,Value-for-money,"I paid only 10798 Rs only for 32 inch Model on Republic Sale. Received the product on scheduled date with same day installation,They don't give wall mount and remote batteries in the pack Picture quality is Good with this price Default color settings are little fade but i customized it from settings.Sound is Great ,WiFi direct is not available, We can use Mirror screen via Google Home Application and Gallery Acess via All Screen Application (Internet access required to intial connect),some times it dont work thats the only issue in MI TV 32inch thatsy im giving 3 star.Bluetooth is working well,if you are looking a TV in 12K range then u can purchase MI TV ,and you have enough money then i will suggest you to take 17K model (40 Inch). 32 inch clarity is justt okay with that price model. they also gives you 2 year warranty in panel. anyway normal LED model have a life cycle of minimum 3 year. so we no need to take any complete tv protection for MI Tvs.  Good Product, can say value for money"
642,3,Fair,"Image quality is not so good (Average), sound is ok, connectivity is ok, but in this price it's a good product, not a great product but justifies it's price."
643,4,Value-for-money,Good product and good clarity TV I satisfied 👍👍
644,5,Must buy!,"i am so happy , wonderful product, and amazing delivery and instillation is very fast thanks flipkart"
645,5,Highly recommended,"The best tv on this price, it supports Netflix, Prime Videos, Sound and picture is awesome 4k videos also plays well. Must buy it.."
646,5,Super!,"It's awesome to have another MI product in home. Image quality is very good,sound can be improved more, wireless connectivity is so good. The person for installations was very efficient and sincere. Overall 5 ratings out of 5."
647,5,Brilliant,Nowadays we are glued to mobile for all information and entertainment. TV is to soaps to aged ones and cartoon for kiddos.....so for a middle class like me or need to have a separate ones at other rooms it's truly value for money as well as quality.I am not sure about longevity and service as this brand recently entered into tv sector.You get more features wrt to other brands in this price range ie Samsung. or sony
648,4,Pretty good,"I'm writing this review after 2 days of usage:  Display : 5/5 Sound : 2/5 Connectivity : 3/5  YouTube ,primeVideo , Netflix works great. Will keep you guys updated.  Installation was really fast ...it got installed the same day on which it got delivered and the delivery was also really fast. I got it the the very next day of order. So thank u flipkart for the amazing service l.  But the sound quality could have been better afterall it is 10 + 10 watt. Really dissapointed with the sound quality. Other things are good. Thanks."
649,5,Great product,It's awesome best and best Smart TV
650,5,Wonderful,"It's good picture quality ,sound is good but not more effective like woofer ,but overall it is must watch full tv feuters are ousoms"
651,5,Terrific,Very fast delivery Nonu Ki Pasand Very good picture Very good Sound Very good Smart TV
652,4,Wonderful,Can say a good budget Smart TV. It is HD ready not fully HD. But it doesn't matter anyway. At this price you will not get anything better than this.
653,5,Mind-blowing purchase,I am writing this review after using 10 days. I am using all the features of the TV. All features are very good and working very well. And facing the problem of screen mirroring but that was my fault.. TV is good if you want to use the Miracast features you must have a router. Without router Miracast is not possible. After using the router I am facing no problem all are good Miracast working very well. I think no company will provide this kind of features in this budget. I am very happy and fully satisfied with this TV. Thanks to Flipkart and thanks to MI for providing us such a good quality TV. I am giving 6 star out of 5.. thanks again for supporting Flipkart and the MI service centre.
654,3,Does the job,It's nice mi led smart 4a pro but mirror screen connect nothing good enough....
655,4,Worth the money,Led is perfect sounds and picture quality all are good but no option available castscreen without Internet firstly connect the internet thn connect castscreen
656,4,Really Nice,"nice TV, installation engineer behavior is very good, he explain all details. For crome cast required fast internet like 10-12 mbps. other all functions are very good."
657,5,Brilliant,Pictures and sound quality is very good but cust setting is verry bad.... Other wise every thing is good
658,5,Terrific purchase,Awesome and best valuable worthy smart TV Paisa wasool 😊
659,5,Best in the market!,Dont think just buy it you will love its features..tv is really a beast .. Great product i love it
660,3,Nice,"Play store of this TV supports very few apps unlike actual Android TVs which support almost all apps. Also, remote is not user friendly. On the brighter side, the product is still an excellent value for money. Picture quality is fairly good."
661,5,Classy product,"I got this MI LED Tv just at # 11,999....i must say that at this price range this is the best tv u will find online as well as in the market....till now there is nothing that i didn't like about it..... it's just awesome #IF u r planning to buy this , just go for it ."
662,5,Terrific purchase,Mi tv superb I'm very happy for product... but installation boys didn't came I fitting by own. Procust was super
663,5,Must buy!,Nice picture quality and price is perfect good product MI is best
664,4,Pretty good,Rewiew after using for a week and a half. 1.Feature rich at this price bracket. 2. Picture quality is top notch. 3. Wifi connectivity is good. 4. Magic remote:🌟🌟🌟🌟. 5. Apps are downloadable from Google playstore.  But the main drawback is the software.' Mi Patchwall' OS is laggy. Which leads to restart the tv some time.(happened 2 times). And speaker are loud but un balanced ;Volume fluctuates alot.  * Overall the Tv is good to have.*
665,5,Just wow!,no doubt it's the best TV at this price range. and even better than some expensive ones. the sound could have been a little better but overall the best. been using it for a week and must say it was a good decision going to MI
666,4,Value-for-money,Good value for money but screen cast doesn't work and picture quality is not that good as compared to that of samsung or sony TVs.
667,4,Nice product,"Sound quality is perfect but picture quality is average.Although it's not a full HD TV, but as a HD ready TV it should have better picture quality."
668,5,Excellent,Superb TV. Nice picture quality. Good sound. HD content looks very crisp and clear. Connectivity is also good. Worth every penny. Go for it.
669,5,Brilliant,"Installation and timing was very punctual and good .demo was very good ,technician naveen kumar was very good to explain ,everything to me ."
670,5,Simply awesome,"Changed my opinion AFTER SYSTEM UPDATE.  It's got released a new updated recently and that include 1. Turn on directly into TV/AV/HDMI/USB mode without doing anything ( So much helpful for my parents to operate ) 2. PIE android update. Of course good but it has some cons. Read below. 3. Certified Netflix, Amazon prime and hotstar. 4. No more annoying patchwall forcement.  Here's my experience with the TV so far  Pros : 1. Size of TV is good enough for a mid-sized living room and thin bezels gives an immersive feel. 2. Display is clear, sharp and well saturated. Of course not OLED quality but you'll enjoy for sure. Best for the price range. 3. Sound is good. Loudness is very high that it could be hear in any corner of larger hall. No need to plan for any additional speaker if you wish to place in mid-sized room. 4. The remote is magic. It connects to TV as soon as TV powered up. You'll never know that's a wireless remote. It feels as functional as IR but works in any direction. 5. The awesome thing is using android tv remote app or mi tv remote app to control the TV. ( To the lazy people out there ) 6. There are many more but cons are what we more interested into.  Cons : These are my honest experiences while using TV. I'll mention even little frustration things also.  1. Auto power on isn't present. I know I'm asking high for a TV in this budget but I wanted my tv to auto turn on power on so that my parents need not to search for remote and press the power button on remote. 2. ~2 min booting time (starting time). Well yeah, the ANDROID TV. Better we just got something like softboot here. 3. No miracast. Only screencast provided. Let me make it clear, screencast needs internet to cast the screen while miracast doesn't. Miracast is deprecated from pie. 4. Drinking data heavily. If you are a guy like me visiting home once in a while and using hotspot for accessing Android services, you'll cry daily. Within a half an hour of watching content 1.5 will expire. With data saver turned on, it lasts 20 mins more. Not complaining. 5. You can't use external/phone remote keyboard to search in youtube. You have to select each button to enter text or have to use voice search. 6. Mismatch audio volume for TV and Android UI. I need to raise volume higher on TV IN and lower on using android UI. 7. Laggy and slow UI. My fingers on remote are way faster than TV here. 8. NO RECENT APPS. Like other android TVs this one doesn't have recents apps view. i.e, you can't switch between recently opened apps. It will close an app if you come back. No an issue.  These were the minor issues that I've come across so far. But those things can't even disturbed my love upon this TV. Everytime I turn on, it feels amazing and the tactile feel of buttons on remote is heaven. ❤️  Plan. Research. Decide. Buy. Enjoy !"
671,5,Mind-blowing purchase,Thx to flipkart the delivery is before than delivery date the mi tv pictures quality awesome best tv in flipkart best price thank to flipkart.

678,5,Terrific,best smart tv in best price using since 3 mnths..amazing work by mi brand..very happy..
679,5,Terrific purchase,It's a value for money product as is the case with any MI product. HD picture quality is very impressive in case of online streaming or DTH. Sound quality may not be topnotch but satisfactory. Remote is very responsive but the built quality could have been better. Overall a Pakage deal at this price point. Please check for new entries in the market before taking a decision because every day something new is being launched.

703,4,Nice product,Value for Money. There is lag in chromecast via Mobile but it's with all MI smart TVs. Bluetooth connectivity is very low - it requires alot of efforts to connect the external device. Bluetooth range is widely good - I tested within 15-20 meters of range and it worked very well. Overall very nice product If you have internet broadband connection.
704,4,Pretty good,"I got this at reasonable price. picture and sound quality is good but I am facing mirrorcasting issue. it not supporting as expeted. it got disconnected after some time, I need to connect again and again."

751,5,Highly recommended,Nice product mi led love it my dream led
752,5,Terrific purchase,Nice viewing and easy connectivity with Google home. you can convert your TV in mobile easily. Very economic and easy to use.
753,4,Good choice,"I purchased this tv for both entertainment as well as playing PUBG. The main problem while playing PUBG is it makes too much troubles while screen casting. High speed internet is must at least 10 mbps for smooth screen mirroring any object from phone. It uses same amount of data for screen mirroring which is necessary for uploading the content on net. On the other hand in sony or Samsung tv's we can screen cast without internet. Overall quality is good compared to price. I purchased this TV on 3 no cost EMI. with Flipkart 3 year complete protection which cost me Rs.18271 at the time of checkout and on payment page, now my bank sent me notification to pay Rs.6222 + GST which is too much and Flipkart people are not taking any action. TV quality is good if we use HD connection with HD channels. Without HD, its looks below average.  Hope MI release any update to connect TV to mobile without internet.  Can anyone tell me how to connect mobile to tv without using data? screen mirroring from Realme 3Pro to this tv."
754,3,Does the job,4k. Color quality is good but sound is low as well as sound quality is not good
755,3,Just okay,Smart connect is not properly happening. we need internet to screen mirror and it gets stuck while playing video or photos. need improvement in smart connect.
756,4,Good Quality and Value-for-money,"This product is very good and I'm totally satisfied with its features, sound and picture quality. Cost is very less compared to other brands(sony samsung,LG etc) but quality is similar to it. Also, Customer care support is good and I recommend all to go for this product.  cons: Remote is a Bluetooth remote and we need to handle it with care. No control option given in TV panel for accessing in case if remote not working."
757,5,Mind-blowing purchase,I am really happy with the performance of this led tv.Its quality is best in smart TV. Also thanks for Flipkart for delivery in time.
758,4,Worth the money,Very Good Video Quality and Sound. Wireless Screen cost Display feature difference and difficult Compare to Mi LED Smart TV 4A and all other features is Excellent
759,3,Good,"Using it for a month.Now if we talk of the television here are the pros and cons which you must consider while buying this television.  1.Picture Quality  -->Viewing angles aren't impressive because tv produces good colors when viewed straight and the colors start to wash out at an angle as low as 60° -->Contrast levels are ok,as long as you do not compare this tv side by side with any other you wont notice any huge difference as blacks are fine. -->Tv is ok in a lit room while with a dark room you cant see deep blacks as you can notice screen bleeding. Since most of us will use it in a lit room this wont be a great issue. -->Setupbox SD channels look good at a distance of minimum 8 feet(Quality can vary depending upon setup boxes) -->HD looks fine and even you can run 4K videos.However after the recent november update you cant watch 4K videos on youtube which was supporting 4K earlier. -->Refresh rate is good for a day to day use and is standard in this budget.   2.Sound  -->Fine for a 20 feet×25 feet hall. -->Dialogues are clear and loud. -->A simpler equaliser could have been a plus point but missing -->Different modes available to choose as per one's choice which is good  3.Connectivity  -->Weak point of this tv -->Chromecast is pain I am unable to cast screen using any phone. -->Ports are quite far in the interior rendering it difficult to reach due to very small gap between Tv and wall better to get a moving wall mount. -->Internet is ok,Youtube,Netflix etc runs fine on a mobile 4G connection for a 720p videos(25 Mbps connection) with minor lags here & there but for a 1080p and 4K suggestion is a stable 50Mbps connection -->Using External Hard drives,Pendrives is smooth.  4.Updates  -->Recieved two updates in a month which fixed some issues however has few bugs which are still not corrected. -->New features like TV lock has been provided which is good.  5.Miscellaneous  -->Sometime ago,TV was not getting shut down even with the button on the TV as well as the remote,however it was solved with a factory reset. -->UI is responsive though lags for few seconds after bootup which can be ignored.   Conclusion  • When buying keep after-sales service in focus. With 2 years warranty on panel it is a good deal over the price range if someone lives in a remote area. •For city dwelling people,make an informed choice putting a significant focus on your personal preferences. •Buying it after considering all these wont regret you."
760,5,Perfect product!,best money value best quality and best features best Android system and best sound

You can't expect Crisp sharp colour as we see in Sony ,Samsung like high branded one ..Better buy 32"" Sony or Samsung or LG for this price .. Expected lot but exited with disappointment .. As there is no return but only replacement , so think more before buying this ... Trust me guys"
765,5,Highly recommended,"I got it only 11249/- Delivery was very nice. Installation by jeevs, installation boy was very nice.very nice clearity, very nice sound,and very nice look.thank you flipkart,thank you MI and thank you Jeevs."
766,5,Great product,"You cannot ask for more at this price. This changes the way you look at a TV! With the new Android 9 update, it gets Netflix and Prime Video as well. A more than complete product at this price!  Pros: 1. Google assistant works like a charm with the cutest remote for a TV. 2. All entertainment in one place! 3. Excellent sound quality from the speakers. 4. Best connectivity you can ask for. Wifi, Bluetooth, Chromecast.... a lot!  Cons: 1. Picture colour changes on changing the viewing angle horizontally. 2. Cannot dim the TV backlight or turn off display while playing music. Xiaomi should work on this to provide shortcuts for turning off display or dimming the lights while music playback. 3. The storage is a bit less, limited to 4GB usable memory.  Overall: A must buy for the price!"
767,3,Decent product,"Don't get me wrong, the product is amazing. Under 20k, I believe it is the best product available in the market. The picture and audio quality is superb. I watch Airtel HD channels on it and it is simply spectacular. Add to that the credibility of Xiaomi, I believe the deal during Big Billion days was a steal. However , I had a bad experience with Flipkart. It took them 39 days to fulfill the order and I haven't even received any apology from them. However, the product itself is quite good and if you are getting it under 20k, go for it blindly."
768,4,Good quality product,"Mi led smart tv pros and cons pros in built chrome cast. easy to navigate inbuilt google search picture quality ok  cons chrome cast lags from mi phone but works fine with hotstar, vodafone play app which has feature of chrome cast to device so if your phone doesn't have chromecast inbuilt than u will experience lag issue  sound quality is not stereo at all you need to have good speaker if you fond of sound"
769,3,Does the job,"I bought this tv on 25th November and get installed by 26th November the service of mi is very good👌 . but the engineer was very rude to me😐 his talking sense was very bad . before buying this tv plz read this description below👇 Picture :-- 4/5 rating... this tv has the best picture quality we have played some 4k videos on YouTube and it looks very nice with 40"" inch♥️... set box channels may disturb you for sometime but you no need to buy a HD set top box the best way to watch tv is keep your tv to a far distance after that you will see the difference😉  Sound :-- 5/5... the sound quality is too good it covers a whole room with clear sound effect , bass is good with this 20 w sounds loved it♥️  Connectivity :-- first of all i casted my mi phone with the tv and it worked fine 👍 but after that (when engineer gone) i tried to connect oppo phone it shows only volume up and down cast 😐 after that I retried my mi phone and the phone is showing ""casting mi 4a "" but screen is blank , all i can say the connectivity of this tv worst , youtube works ""sometime"" not all the time you open it 😒  all i can say about this tv has only one weakness that is the connectivity of this tv over all its very nice tv😘  Like it if you find something useful in this comment👍"
770,5,Best in the market!,sound quality is very good u cant expect a good picture quality but if u are watching in hd then it is satisfying. chromecast is not working properly. overall a good tv at this budget.
771,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"TV display quality is decent on this price, we should not compare it with samsung and Lg brand, they have much better picture quality. sound is enough. since, it is android tv, it is loaded with all required application. 8gb internal memory is for installing and downloading other apps. The jeeva service is pathetic, the better thing that customer satisfaction is required post instalation which is taken by Flipkart/ mi call center where you can lodge ur dissatisfaction. overall, i recommend ppl to buy this. i bought it with 3 yrs warranty, but, the t&c of guaranteed return needs to be explorred before opting."
772,4,Good choice,After reading all the reviews and feedbacks regarding connectivity issues I still went ahead and ordered this tv on Nov 14th 19.  Delivery happened as informed and installation guy also came on the same day. Everything is fine except connectivity. You need a high speed internet WiFi to work with the TV. Mobile hotspot is not enough and gives low performance.
773,5,Highly recommended,simply awesome.. you can't get better than this in this price.. smart and fast delivery.. but I didn't avail the complementary installation facility..
774,5,Terrific purchase,awsome television as always because it's my second MI TV purchase.. one year before I have purchased the MI 4C TV. that's working very fine.. everything is good. I got this television on a very special price during diwali sale that is only 8999/- with all discounts included. really a superb TV. and yes most important it's budget friendly. thanku MI
775,5,Fabulous!,I am writing the review after a long time of the purchase almost 4 months... till now I have no issues.. it a best buy at this price segment.. if you are looking for buying a TV at this live just go with it... at this price segment this is the best TV you can ever have..
776,4,Really Nice,Valuable for my money super option in this tv super tv my family likes it
777,3,Good,I would not recommend this TV just because of it's picture quality. You can't enjoy HD display with this. Sound and connectivity is good. You can't watch non HD channel with MI TV and picture quality is not clear if you watch TV by side angle. My suggestions to Mi TV team : please improve picture quality others is good.
778,4,Very Good,picture quality is good through all angles but sound quality is not smooth and clear as compared to other tvs.Overall i will rate 3.5/5
779,5,Great product,"I just loved this tv. it's quite awesome, after an update now it's become a real smart led tv. i bought it for just 10k on big billion day offer"
780,5,Brilliant,"The Best experience with MI TV as compared to other companies this MI TV is so best and pictures quality of this TV is too good as well as sound system is awesome, connectivity is also good over all i will give 100 out of 100."
781,5,Mind-blowing purchase,very good tv and is pocket friendly.picture and sound quality is awesome. Very good performance. Buddy go for it without any hesitation.. Hazel free shipment and installation..
782,5,Wonderful,super worth of money go for it as a budget one buy when there is a sale will get it at final best price
783,5,Brilliant,"it's awesome and more over it's worth to money. the quality is much better than other branded TV's like Samsung and lg. Flipkart service is too good, they were delivered in time and fitted very perfectly. thanks for fast delivery and good service..."
784,5,Best in the market!,very good product and a good thing is that it is voice control and also Google is present for helping it looks great and stylish according to the style of room
785,4,Value for money product,"See, at this price point, MI TV 4A is a brilliant buy.  But when you buy this MI TV 4A, I would suggest you to stop comparing it with any other brand. Because at this price, you won't get anything better than this period.  Regarding the product, it's good, build quality is satisfactory, the picture quality is satisfactory, the sound is good, connectivity options works great, and what else do you expect? smart features? they work flawlessly if you have got a high-speed internet connection.  Installation was a breeze, done on the same day it was delivered.  I've got it for around 16K, with Diwali discounts."
786,5,Brilliant,"thanks flipkart I bought this TV just rs 10349 rupees in festive session. my review this TV picture quality is good, sound very good, connectivity is good and installation is very very good"

793,4,Pretty good,"good, very good product and nice picture and good quality and all' is good"
794,5,Classy product,good experience with Flipkart . installation and demo was done by (Jeeves services Pvt Ltd )by Mr. Nagendra Pal was very good and he was very polite and co-operative to help for his service.and thanks for there team support.
795,5,Highly recommended,"Bought it for my mom.. She loves it.. I am starting to like the MI brand now.. The picture quality is really good, sometimes a tiny bit over saturated it wouldn't bother anyone but the sound quality could have been better.. I think my next purchase will be their 4K tv.. I have got no complaints.. Got the installation done a day before the scheduled time. I would recommend this tv its a value for the money.. :)"
796,4,Nice product,value for money biggest positive is speaker of the tv. sound is clear and rich in comparison to older mi tv models of the last year.
797,4,Really Nice,"Its great deal with fK, its smart tv same as android smrart phone in best prize 9999."
798,5,Great product,Really good TV in affordable price. Colour quality is very good with nice sound experience.
799,5,Terrific purchase,Its a really awesome Smart TV.. picture quality is absolutely fine..and all things are really awesome.This is best samrt TV with this budget.But I m so disappointed with the delivery service of filpkart.I got my product after 1.5 month..and the filpkart dose a wrong commitment to me that as a comapntation it will give a gift voucher.but i don't get any gift voucher
800,5,Highly recommended,very good i m happy with flipkart sevice and also thank you so much for providing such nice products
801,4,Wonderful,This is good buy in this price point but few points need to be considered -- 1. This tv has 1 GB RAM and may get stucked if many applications are running in background. 2. TV is bit slow in operation. 3. Screen Mirroring doesn't work every time. 4. There is no way to power off tv if hanged. I faced this issue quite a few times. 5. Don't expect extraordinary picture quality.  If you want very fluent performance with a superb picture quality then don't go for it. But if want a decent alround performance in a budget pricing then definitely give it a try.
802,5,Super!,quality of product is good and the best LED in best price
803,5,Great product,Great experience with MI for first time.. i liked this led smart tv too much. also thank you flipkart for delivery timing and installation is very fast

805,5,Great product,Awesome Product and I got this exchange deal with some card offers too but trust me guys MI TV is got my trust and Very Good Deal in this price range. I use this TV with normal Cable connection and I don't face any issue that's why I give 5 date. And last not the least Internet and Voice assistance Remote is also awesome. Lots of Pre-installed Apps but my favorite is YouTube. Thank you Flipkart
806,5,Classy product,TV is awesome sound is awesome picture clarity super but LED Wall mount cost is too high insulation person take 2000 without bil
807,4,Value-for-money,"we are very happy thanks for Flipkart. it's veluble for money and good picture quality and volume also 👌👌. thank you ""Mi"""
808,4,Worth the money,"Satisfied with the product quality, but not happy with Mirror/Chrome Cast functionality... Would recommend Mi to re assess their build on this aspect..such functions should be easy to use..but this seems nearly impossible functions to use regularly... otherwise all super awesome tV... One star less for this flaw"
809,5,Fabulous!,"best buy. flipkart delivery and installation was satisfactory. abit slow in loading applications like YouTube, Netflix, prime, etc.. sound and picture quality is impressive. patchwall is better than android tv interface. Happy"

822,4,Nice product,very good product at very low price....MI is doing great for low budget people. and also thanks to flipkart for delivery and good service
823,5,Must buy!,For the price this is by far the best LED Tv with official android tv os. Good enough for watching TV and casting screen. Won't recommend installing too many apps since ram is just 1GB and may feel sluggish.
824,4,Good choice,wow wonderful.. smart led TV.. great product got at great price..

831,5,Highly recommended,The led was amazing and picture quality was pretty good over the led was amazing you have to try this led at once
832,5,Worth every penny,Proper demo not given by installer how to mirror cast and how to load other app and how to use its memory very bed experience not proper guide but Flipkart nice delivery main issue is mirror cast otherwise best product.
833,5,Terrific,"After using 5 months, I am writing this TV review. 1. Picture quality is good. 2. Sound is excellent compare to this price range. 3. User-friendly and operating also flexibly. 4. I am impressed with app performances like mobile. Finally, I am recommend this Mi TV for small budget."

I just love the tv .I suggest go for the tv for your peace of mind you can purchase the extended warranty
835,5,Awesome,awesome tv. one thing that mi does wrong that they dont provide batteries with the mi remote. but a nice and terrific product attaching some images for a better idea how does the product actually looks
836,5,Excellent,The product is excellent. no need to cable or any Dish for playing the TV. only internet connection and subscription of few web-channel such as Netflix or Hotstar or Hoichoi is sufficient. nice picture quality. Gaming experience also fine you can play Pubg mobile in this TV. Besically it is not a TV it's Computer. you can download many games and channels in this TV. Google Playstore is perfectly working in this TV. Its not a TV its besically a computer or a Big mobile. I am fully satisfied.
837,2,BAD Clarity,"Clarity is not upto the mark what they are advertising. And the most important feature is not available i.e. ""SCREEN MIRRORING"" if you want to do so then Dual Router is needed."
838,5,Just wow!,best TV under budget and the TV is performing well thanks to Flipkart safely delivered to my house and the installation by Jeeves is very good wonderful.
839,4,Good choice,Everything is better with a comfortable price except smart view and casting which supports only in limited apps.... overall satisfying product for normal use
840,5,Perfect product!,awesome deal with Flipkart happy for faster service good product as compared other this one is better available more features

846,5,Fabulous!,"the product is excellent but services I have got from Flipkart is very horrible. they took more than 20 days to deliver and install the product. they have not kept their promises, they have extended dates everytime rather than solving problems, the customer service support was humble but still not satisfactory. I will never order big products like tv, fridge, Washing machine from Flipkart.."

Disappointed with delivery and demo installation both has been delayed. TV installation I have called so many times to Flipkart and ""Jeeves consumer"" services which is partner of Flipkart, I've faced very bad experience and they told like will finish installation end of the day but they won't and also one more important update that is allocated service engineer hasn't pic calls properly from us. Finally after 5 days they came after raised so many concerns. For delay delivery Flipkart said will provide 500 gift voucher with in 24 hrs but that also they hasn't."

857,5,Super!,superb smart TV. Thank you flipkart for fast delivery.
858,4,Wonderful,"Good but screen mirroring option works only with internet connected with same device ,where as linux smart no need internet for tv and as well as phone"
859,5,Excellent,"Very good purchase. the TV is really very good. I puchased it after going through lots of reviews. There are certain reviews on Youtube about bad installation service. But, in my case the installation service and Flipkart delivery both were very good. I am watching TV programmes through local cable connection which is actually of SD quality, but the TV display is so good that it looks like HD quality picture. I also purchased 3 years extended warranty, so need not to worry about after sales service. I recomend this product as it provides value for money."
860,5,Must buy!,"i am the big fan of Xiaomi products and i always love mi this is my most trusted brand..and this tv is awesome bought it for 10,300 on offer in this price no other tv can beat this in features it has android and Xiaomi patchwall os display is crystal clear speakers are also great and finally Flipkart delivery is also good"

One can download 4k videos and feel the 4k while playing it. Patchwall is the best when compared with Android 9 the best is the TV manager app which optimize the TV apps, memory and so on."
870,4,Really Nice,"the tv is good at this price, but the connectivity is slow. and the best part is after update to android 9 netflix and prime are supportable. u can fit to movable wallmount also. the service of Flipkart is good. I called the service twice he came and did the installation. thank you flipkart"
871,5,Worth every penny,Well it's worth buying this product. fits perfectly under the budget and you can't expect more from a smart TV at this price.
872,5,Classy product,MI LED TV smart best TV best quality sound best quality video

874,4,Delightful,"nice product at this price,every thing is good in every aspect,so nothing to think about it & go on for such a super@ amazing smart tv"
875,5,Mind-blowing purchase,Pros  1. Can be viewed from all angles 2. Great sound 3. Easy connectivity 4. Fast delivery of product and installation  Cons  1. Need support for more Android apps 2. Airtel xplay app support or jio tv app support would be great
876,5,Brilliant,After 2 months of using I would suggest in this range this is the best Smart TV you ever buy. worth the money
877,4,Wonderful,"The best TV you can buy for 10k. Picture is good, Connectivity is super with chromecast inbuilt. Sound is fine considering the price. Will definitely recommend."
878,5,Brilliant,I’m really happy to buy this amazing product. Ui is pretty cool. Remote access is really smart.overall performance of the product is first class.
879,4,Value-for-money,"Good sound and rich colour while watching in Hotstar, YouTube and Prime Video. The sound and colour is not good while watching in TV."
880,5,Mind-blowing purchase,Awesome one of the best smart led tv by mi 4a pro
881,5,Perfect product!,Mi led tv best wish you very nice product good quality Paisa vasool
882,5,Great product,looking very fine and nice tv... such a beautiful picture and sound quality value for money.. one more important point is wonderful installation and demo from flipkart service .. i m feel very well to buy this tv through flipkart
883,5,Excellent,If u have good budget then go with mi 40 & 43 inch tv because all 32 inch led have little bit blurry that's why I told u that... Humble request to you...Go for full HD...
884,4,Good choice,"The TV is nice. I won't say Spectacular or anything because I have seen far better panels. But in this price point, this is the best TV you can have. Booting up the TV takes some time for sure may be because of Android interface. Voice control and navigation are quite easy. Screen quality is good enough and HD content play very good. In built sound is adequate for a small room. This panel isn't HDR so don't expect HDR content One problem I always face with WiFi. The TV never gets connected to wifi automatically. it's an error or what i dont know. But everytime I have to go to settings and then Click on WiFi to get wifi connected. Though I don't put my password on daily basis, it has the password in its memory but it doesn't connect to it automatically. The TV doesn't come with HDMI ARC. Now a days HD audio is a feature for home theatres and this doesn't give you HDMI ARC support. This TV clearly is built for the Soundbar from Mi as the soundbar also doesn't have HDMI ARC support. Another huge complaint I have with Mi is The TV DOESN'T COME WITH ANY CABLES. Only one power cord is supplied. A FullHD TV must come with an HDMI cable atleast. But this TV has absolutely no cables supplied with it, only a powercord."
885,5,Best in the market!,Best pecture quality for mi led and sound good .best price and led colour is to good
886,4,Nice product,"Bought this TV for one of the guest rooms.  PROS 1. Picture quality is very good. 2. Easy to use and very crisp and simple UI. Navigating and locating settings was quite self explanatory. 3. The TV looks very appealing and the connector panel behind is very convenient than most other TVs that I've used. 4. Leaves a good amount of space from the wall mounted, thus giving it improved room for circulation as compared to other LED TVs. 5. The remote is sleek.  CONS 1. Need an AV button on the remote. That would make it easier to use. A more detailed remote would help. Especially for users who are not comfortable using firestick like controls to manage their TV. For me personally, this isn't an issue. 2. Sound quality could use some improvement.  P.S. Haven't tested the connectivity, as this TV is for guests' use and not personal use.  All in all a highly recommended TV for the rate. I loved it. If looking for a medium budget LED TV, this is the one to go for."
887,2,Expected a better product,nice Tv comper to other.. but vary bad with tv interface and remot control. need deatils remote. no pictures quality change in Feture while pictures is on no mode change like equalizer other things.. be Careful with remote user interface before u purchase..its not suitable for all age of family member ..no mute button. no keys of numbers on remote nither other main button like as old tv interfaces has.

899,5,Excellent,"The TV is totally worth the price but you cannot compare the picture quality with brands like LG, Samsung etc which are way better but of course the price is double. The technician sent by Flipkart for installation was trying to charge me Rs. 850/- for the wall mount when the actual price is just 500/-"
900,5,Wonderful,A good Android TV indeed. superb purchase. value for money. I like this TV very much. You can go for it blindly. Also good installation and demo. Liked it most.
901,5,Brilliant,tv is installed it is superb and shamsher has also give the demo very nicely and we understood everything thanks to jeeves enterprises for there service very effective and efficiently
902,5,Highly recommended,"The best and the cheapest of the lot, since nobody can match the feature list of this TV at this price. And regarding OS I feel patchwall is way better than Android 9."
903,4,Nice product,"PRODUCT: LOVE ..Xiaomi Strike's Again.... Mi hits Next forestep with an Another good Quality Tv product.... India's No 1 selling Indust Xiaomi on Both TV's nd Redmi Mobiles confirmed, Its Growth level Will be continue to Forward. Best Economical- Quality_Budget friendly TV in market. Good picture.. Great sound..  DELIVERY: The only Dissappointment was goes on the Flipkart delivery service. I got the tv after 18 days from Order... The comes to my Nearest hub, and they keep it In THERE hub storage for FIVE DAYs, after my continuous complaint to the fipkart they deliverd it on the 18th day..  Installation done Quickly.."
904,2,Not good,New model is wast old model is better than new model bcoz old model direct TV on news model set HTML setting.... Cast is not working directly old easy way to work the casting
905,5,Excellent,after using it for 1 month I can say that it's the best tv in this range.the installation and demo was very smooth and was scheduled on the very same day when it was delivered.I am glad to get this beauty in my home.
906,4,Nice product,Extremely happy with the picture quality in Full HD. Sound quality is not so good. Feels a negligible lag qhile surfing in Patchwall. Search option using current keypad is little cumbersome task. Would be more happy if this interface changes to bit more user friendly mode. These are few improvement areas. Overall performance is good. Value for money!!
907,5,Just wow!,Superb product.. Awesome picture quality... I am just loving it. I am gonna refer this to many people. Close your eyes and buy this product that's all I can suggest.
908,5,Best in the market!,"Best product I have bought so far. Very satisfied. Saved me money not only on discount and the price range it comes in but also that it is very energy efficient that old CRT TV, less cable expenses on month end, don’t have to use PC and Smartphones all the time, easy access to all the contents.  Bluetooth remote works very well as well. Display quality is very good too considering that it’s not full HD but I have played 4K videos very smoothly with premium digital experience.  Installation process was very short and helpful. Installation person seemed rude in the beginning but he was professional as he should be and did a nice work.  This is just my one week review. There is more in this product."
909,5,Fabulous!,value of money all things are great and for the installation who came he was very kind and polite . Overall performance is good
910,4,Value-for-money,it's a good product from mi. price is reasonable and you can get latest features. picture quality is good sound is also good you can install apps using Google Play you tube is installed already it's a hd ready TV not a full hd one. can connect with WiFi suppoerts screen mirroring 8gb ram is there out of which 4 GB is usable(4gb for os) it's little hard to connect usb becz it's on the backside still that is fine. over all rating is 4/5
911,5,Terrific purchase,super nice product very fast installation thank u flipkart & mi
912,5,Brilliant,bahut acha hai smart phones ki trh smart TV 🙂 best top company new mi
913,5,Super!,"mi Tv is really good , picture quality, sound quality is good , it's very light weight and easy to install but there's connectivity issue. Over all totally worth it. i would highly recommend this product."
914,3,Good,Giving review after two years of use..tv worked well these years..but all of sudden some hardware failed and functions are working on its own without remote usage..
915,5,Highly recommended,"android TV super parfomnce, if you have bugat than buy sony. but if you want good TV in low range than this is great tv"
916,3,Nice,The picture and sound is god in this price. Go for HD set top box and HD channel then you will get the real experience. I had to buy a New HD set top box otherwise local cable connection picture with SD set top box on this MI 40 cm tv not upto the mark. Miracast is not happening as screen monitaring on MI tv you need two separate phone for connecting small screen sharing from your phone to MI tv. My oppo and vivo is not working for screen sharing. you need a sound bar if you want bass.
917,4,Delightful,for the price point its good but the installation guy is on a hurry to do and fly away ... they will charge another 399 rupee for wall mount aprat from this picture quality is good when you connect with hotspot and watched full hd pictures and its not that good when connected to the cabel connection
918,5,Worth every penny,MI TV is best in 32inch segment. Picture quality really good compared to others. Sound is good. With fully loaded functions. Budget product. Value for money. If you want 32inch led TV then MI is the best option.
919,4,Pretty good,"This TV is based on Android 6, which is a little old version. Also, not all types of Pen Drives are supported in the USB port. I tried to run a movie from HP Pen Drive, but it did not support the drive. The same movie ran from a SanDisk OTG drive. Rest okay."
920,5,Just wow!,Mi LED smart TV is good and picture quality No1 I love Mi smart TV
921,5,Brilliant,"best product .In this price it is a best product .good quality images,sound and connectivity.5 out of 5 .plzzz try it once .its amazing"
922,5,Internet is not Working Properly,"Over All Product is Good, but Net Connectivity is very Poor, as good as simple LED TV we can use, not Like smart TV Need improvement,Net will so Connect , but Internet not Working in TV"
923,5,Classy product,"It's nice product. Picture quality is awesome. Features like connectivity with pen drive, mobile is cool. At this rate this TV is more cost beneficiary. This price range for 32 inch TV has forced all other companies to reduce their price and thus made more affordable to general public to see good quality tv with big screen and smart connectivity in affordable price. I recommend it to buy if your budget is around 10k. Thanks mi...."
924,4,Nice product,"Go for it guys I’m sure you will not regret for your decision to buy one of this tv the price you are paying is worth. I bought 2 mi tv, one 4x 43” and another 4a 32”. Both of them are have almost same quality, 4a 32” user can update your mi tv and you will get amazon prime, Netflix as well once updated & to be honest the picture quality really depends on you WiFi speed rather than that this is the best tv at this price tags. Please don’t compare with Samsung tv, Sony tv they are the leading brands."
925,4,Really Nice,"think before purchase, because this TV has not mirracast feature, Chromecast cast function only works online,if we want to see our mobile phone SD card offline content it cutting our data balance,, those who want to see them SD cards offline content Chromecast may eating your your data balance and TV will getting it's stomach full,............ other wise TV is awesome ,but think of Chromecast"
926,5,Best in the market!,Got it in 17k in bbd it is worth it more then. Super clarity and audio quality is awesome. Guys buy it without any doubt.
927,5,Mind-blowing purchase,Very Good product. My family like it very much.. Thank you Flipkart. Got the product at the price of 10999 only.
928,4,Delightful,it is value worth led TV good for normal use best picture and sound quality
929,5,Brilliant,nice tv in this price segment. timely delivery and installation on the same day . youtube. hotstar. prime videos.zplay ee5.play store. screen mirror of jio tv jio cinema. everything runs fantastic
930,5,Great product,"screen nit clear when showing , like stage show type scene more coloured ful scene picture pixcle scratch , for best picture quality iam not recommended . but this price ok. still iam not getting warranty document"
931,5,Simply awesome,Best quality best item best service I love it...
932,4,Worth the money,This good budget tv ...sound quality very good ...pic quality not grate this HD view ...android superb ...remote quality not good like plastic remote ...*packing with no battery’s and wall mounted * android little slow to exit app
933,4,Worth for money,Good delay for money.... I happy with product but delivery and installation time was more . Difficult to get know the smart futures in tv like smart mirroring and others . Very less information in user guide . Overall experience with mi was good and need little more improvements for user friendly.
934,4,Good choice,mi led was superb but it's mirror connecting is not so good it disconnect after 10 to 15 min and it's picture quality is very very good and sound quality also.
935,5,Awesome,good good television if you want to buy this this is great product of Flipkart I like this product very much this was the first i have brought and I am very happy from this this delivery was also good and the shipping was observed to fast this was the first television which I have brought from my own salary and I am very happy from my choice that I brought this TV
936,5,Wonderful,Awesome product in affordable price. I hesitate in buying TV online but in exchange of my old TV I get great value for money.
937,4,Wonderful,Its a great product. probably the best u can get at this price range but miracast doesn't work effectively
938,5,Perfect product!,"So finally putting this review after using this MI 4A TV. This product in such a price is a steal deal. Let me just mention few of the best features below. 1. Viewing angles are great. No matter at what side of the room you sit. You gonna have the best view. 2. Sound quality of the TV is great. You don't need to add any other speaker if you are a sound listener. 3. Remote control - Bluetooth enabled That's really a revolution in TV segments. It is quick, it doesn't need a direction. It's flawlessm 4. Bluetooth connectivity in the TV. Yeah you read it correct, no need to buy any wire to connect your bluetooth enabled speakers. Now just plug and play. 5. Inbuilt chrome cast - Last but not the least. This feature of the TV makes it complete. Along with the provided different apps you get the freedom to cast through your mobile/laptop and enjoy the show.  Also, You might not get Netflix and Amazon at time when you start the TV but just give it some time with the internet connectivity. Once it download an update both the above options will be on the go.  Hope my this review helps others to decide. ?"
939,5,Terrific,"great service and amazing tv easy to use just like mobile , service is very nice abd cooperative ."
940,5,Best in the market!,Nice product... Velue of money... Best timing... Courier boy is verry good person... 🙂 Iam full happy
941,3,Nice,"Product is good but color setting is a bit difficult as you can not see the screen (video) while setting the colors, you have to go all the back and check the results of your settings and if it is not set according to your preference then you have to go back again into setting and try another setting and check again in live video. Also eye protection mode removed from settings in this model. It was a good feature and should remain in color/picture settings. There should be more color customization or modes for better viewing experience. Overall good buy at this price."
942,5,Brilliant,"Excellent features and good sound output. Connectivity: wifi, Bluetooth, set top box, usb everything works just fine. watching a streaming show has no lags with decent internet. casting works nice too. remote with voice control works well too installation on the day of delivery.... in short a real value for money plus I got it a good deal price with even exchange of my CRT TV was a real advantage ,Thanks to Flipkart"
943,5,Wonderful,super TV.it is in good quality and I love it is 100% worth thanks Flipkart
944,5,Classy product,Mi LED TV is just like their phones in the market. the OS is so smooth that you feel you are just browsing ok your phone. Excellent product from MI and blockbuster deals from Flipkart. Best buy in TV
945,5,Excellent,Excellent par set up box connection lagane se picture quality utna perfect nai hai.over all excellent product I love it
946,5,Terrific purchase,nice product. good quality. elegant and easy to use
947,4,Nice product,nice mi led smart tv 4a pro.. 108. cm ( 43) me sab kuch hai.... qulity bhi hd ekdum jaada..acha...
948,4,Good quality product,"Well there are soo many reviews about it, but according to me its a value for money! Worth buying (if you're looking for a low cost tv) Also don't expect it to be a high standard quality , its a medium but good quality LED"
949,5,Wonderful,"one gadjet that satisfy all your entertainment need great sound great picture. its very easy to install nd most importantly its light wait Machine. only drawback is, this variant doesn't support Netflix nd prime. but apart from that everything is perfect. thank you Flipkart nd MI for this wonderful opportunity."
950,4,Value-for-money,The product is awesome good... picture quality is good... sounds quality should be better... product packaging should be better... my product has medium size hole in center of the box... i was shocked... The mi service care check it inside out & it was fine... other wise it's good to me...
951,5,Brilliant,Pros ——- 1. Panel is very nice as it is not having any backlight bleeding issue as of now which was present in my Panasonic TV.  2. Sound is quite impressive as it has pretty well balanced bass.  3. Product doesn’t look and feel cheap at all.  4. Delivery and installation was on time.  5. Connectivity was even better as 4K videos was running without any single buffer...  6. Since this tv has Bluetooth which is quite handy when you watch movies at night on your TV and don’t want to disturb others..  7. Google assistance works well.   Cons——  Only cons as of now is the kit used to hang the tv on the wall. Which feels cheap....
952,5,Perfect product!,I bought this mi TV for 17099 rupees .it's a really good TV and worth for money.but Chromecast is not continuous playing .some time it's not connecting also.except Chromecast everything in this TV is good thanks for MI
953,4,Good choice,very good product. picture quality with HD set top box is awesome but with free or SD box is averages. sound is good. overall in this range nice product
954,5,Fabulous!,"it is the best led and low priz, don't miss led and order led soon"
955,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"Great Android TV at low price. All Features are very good. Fast Delivery before expected. Picture quality,sound,connectivity are Superb. value for money. Best Android TV as Compared to Other in that price. Thanks Flipkart...."
956,4,Value-for-money,I used to have Samsung LED TV before and the picture quality of that was much better than this. value for money as its way too much cheaper than other brands.
957,5,Just wow!,I love mi brand because in low price it's provide better product. I bought this mi TV. it function is simple and provide better TV. I suggest you should buy this product in this budget.

961,3,Does the job,very good tv for very low price or smart tv picture is good sound is good wi fi connectivity is good.
962,4,Good quality product,Tv is awesome. Great quality. Good sound. Netflix is not supported though. The connectivity lags sometimes and that is the only defect. You could get 2 year additional warranty for like 1200 or so from installation team. And overall value for money.
963,5,Highly recommended,my review write on use of my LED TV after 1 month best in class other brand LED TV & so reliable for small families
964,5,Worth every penny,MI LED TV is awesome good product installation also good
965,4,Wonderful,"While purchasing this I didn't have any doubt in my mind and I am sure about this product but I got little bit disappointed by some features which should be corrected.  1. Mobile connectivity issue. Whenever you are watching TV and in between you want to connect your phone. This TV doesn't shows instantly. I need to restart the TV in order to connect.  2. As this is an Android TV, so it must have a battery inbuilt to keep in safe from instant power cuts. The battery's work is to shut down the TV properly when input power cuts.  3. Sound is perfect with perfect combination of Bass and Treble.  4. HD channels quality is clear as it was expected.  5. Wifi for YouTube streaming is very perfectly.  6. Most important bluetooth remote is the best thing I have ever seen in remotes.  7. Overall good product in the defined budget."
966,5,Brilliant,picture quality is very good. Sound is awesome. Mi led is very nice product in this range. I am very happy all quality in this led tv 4a pro. Thanks flipkart and thanks Mi.

968,5,Perfect product!,"well overall good in worth 11999 .. .. Pros.. .. .. . 1.connectivity is good whether with wifi Or internet 2.display is fine you will get better quality picture 3,lookwise it's okay but i would recommend that don't go with 32 inch coz it looks tinny n would not give more satisfaction which u will expect 4.value for money in this worth    Cons.. . . . 1.sound is good but if u crank up the volume so it would get distorted and base is like a phone but have good sound for small room.. ."
969,5,Terrific,"sound clarity, image clarity is good, installation also they did same day it work good thank you flipkart"
970,3,Fair,Not very happy as installation was delayed by 3 days. Though the tv works awesome after installation . The surround sound is simply wow. However ease of connectivity was not so good..being a android tv I cannot chromecast my phone on it. Just dont know how. Even when have wifi connected chromecast is problem. Instead of chromecast which requires internet or third device wifi to be connected. Should have given a simpler mirror technology.
971,3,Just okay,"Everyone talks about the good stuff, let me talk about the Cons ! - Too many software glitches, It's been 2 months, TV doesn't get switched off at all, the service engineer came twice to restore the TV to factory settings, to turn the TV off. - No in the box wall mounting frames, like the competitor brands, neither it has those, unusual bolt lengths in the box, was a pain in the a** to get the matching screws to wall mount the TV - Patchwall stopped working on day 5, it says no internet connection, yet youtube,prime, etc runs on the same machine - Screen casting from its own brand mobiles, Poco F1, Mi 4a, Mi 5a are too buggy, glitchy & will never connect in 1st attempt & if it does, it randomly stops at one point of time  Pros: Bright display, Smart/minimal bluetooth remote, easy to use, google assistant comes handy, good sound quality, side loading apps is easy  Hoping for a stable software update, to fix all the issues & kindly train ur executives, from being ""ey aisa hi chaltha hey, can't help"" character"

1002,4,Very Good,picture quality is not much as expected in SD cable connection it's better to have a HD set top box for connection. picture quality looks blur in SD cable for some channels. in other terms product is excellent and worth to buy for this price.

1013,4,Above average budget TV,"Flipkart took 12 days to deliver the product, maybe because of BBD sale. MI 40 inch TV installed on the next day. good build quality. smart features are good.If you are migrating from Sony LG or Samsung you will get disappointed on display and sound. Absence of rich colours and clear sound. Pixels quality is also bad. I like the remote very much. bought at rupees 16200 and took complete TV protection for 3 years for rupees 1300. Experience the display and sound quality on any MI store before buying the product. After updates screen mirroring still not possible"
1014,5,Terrific purchase,Thank you Flipkart for full filling my dream of Led tv. I got it for best offer and best price
1015,4,Worth the money,good picture qwality and good sound of mi led smart TV 4a pro
1016,5,Fabulous!,"Picture quality is too good. I don't know why peoples are complaining about sound. I found it good. I can't exceed the volume beyond 30 whereas max is 100. I connected ps4 with it. Image quality looks pretty awesome. with inbuilt any view cast you can cast your mobile. Remember your normal jiotv or hotstar which you installed from playstore won't work while casting. so you have to use jiotv mod, hotstar mod from xda devolopers to cast it. Watch it on youtube. you can know more about it. Cons: ..."
1017,4,Nice product,I like overall the product but I don't like the sound the vocals are very low if anyone have good sound settings please comment.
1018,5,Brilliant,"Great deal by Flipkart... worth for the money... This is the best one to choose, when you don't want to spend more money for the smart android tvs with the branded ones..."
1019,4,Delightful,good product bought at RS.17999 worth for money installation in soon as well as it's good to use
1020,5,Terrific,value for money on the price offered. light weight and handy remote. patchwall isnt great as it links to multiple paid apps which you have to subscribe. overall a great product
1021,5,Perfect product!,the product is good the delivery is good and the installation is very good and everything is good with this TV if it is not only a TV it is a smart TV which can be used as a monitor of computer and a big smartphone
1022,5,Super!,Value for money product. Its been just a week i had purchased it.. great product. I got it in 11k + 3 year extended warranty in cmplt protection. Its good product. No other compny will provide u the same product in such a affordable price.. display and sound quality is good.. no connectivity issue using hotspot or any other device.. just go for it..
1023,5,Terrific purchase,Super clarity and nice sound ful I love this TV Thank You Flipkart
1024,5,Fabulous!,"I got this TV for 9999 during rush hours. I paid additional 400 for wall mount and bought remote batteries separately, but considering the price of TV I don't want to complain. At this price this was the only smart TV which have good brand name and mi providing additional 1year warranty on panel. Picture quality is good if u have hd settop box and hd content, sound is awesome and it comes with built in Chromecast which is great thing"
1025,5,Great product,Really amazing product in such a decent price. Everything is just amazing about this product and there is no reason of not buying it. Just go for it
1026,4,Very Good,Mi LED smart TV is fine good sound quality but you'll face some connectivity issue. casting is not perfect in some Mobile phones. it take around half minute to start every time. delivery and installation- bad experience sound- good UI & UX - fine launching- not too much good
1027,5,Classy product,"Excellent tv. i got it for 8450 in Big billion sale. No tv in this price range can come close to this quality. Highly recommended.  For new Android TV buyers: not all apps available in mobile are available in MI Android TV or any Android TV in general. very limited number of apps are available. hardly 30-40 apps available that's it.  screen mirroring is done using miracast app which is inbuilt. whatever media you have in your phone like video, audio, pics can be casted to the tv screen without any lag. No hotspot required for mirroring.  After pairing using Google home, u can cast videos from your mobile chrome browser to tv. Also u can cast videos from facebook and YouTube too. Hotspot should be enabled for doing this or must have a common wifi at home.  I still don't understand what is the difference between this TV and MI 4C Pro."
1028,5,Highly recommended,this is a awesome tv.. itna kam price me isse better tv ho hi nhi sakta.. i am really happy. thank u flipkart..
1029,5,Simply awesome,best smart tv ever low prize big benefit

1031,4,Nice product,Good value for money.. thanks to Flipkart for very good offers on this product. Mi LED Smart TV is best in the price range.. Picture quality is good even at bringt lights.. Sound quality is sufficient.. little slow in start and very less RAM so can't install most of the Applications just default app can be run smoothly.. good as common house hold TV but for Tech geeks need more RAM and more faster processor..
1032,2,Slightly disappointed,"After installing the update for Netflix and Amazon support, TV is unable to connect to the router. TV works fine with mobile hotspot. Router works fine with my other devices. But, those two together don't work anymore. I am asked to buy a LAN cable and connect my TV and Router. My mistake - installing an update 🤦"

Display: it plays hd and 4k videos very well watching daily soaps or movies on hd channels is good Sound : it's good but I would prefer connecting 5.1 speakers connectivity: No buffering or connection issues.hd videos play well without any lag provided u have a good internet connection
1039,4,Delightful,"The normal TV picture is too bright even if change the settings,may it will work better with the HD Set top box.But when play directly through WiFi the picture is superb.absolutely a great value for money.Im using it for 4 months, hopefully this will keep giving good services.."

1050,5,Simply awesome,Best Android TV in this range.new update gives Android 9. but the delivery agent is not good he is so rude. installation man is polite. Flipkart should like to make delivery agent more polite. he is so rude. he quarell with me. not good man Flipkart should take inquiry of this. product is nice. fully satisfied of this. thank you.
1051,2,ok,"good picture & sound quality , but many apps not working on this TV please check before buying. only few apps are supported on play store and third party apps not working properly so very dis-pointed.  giving 2 star only display and sound quality very less feature available so think before buying this also if you are going with consumer protection plan then plz read T&C as it wont cancelled once you ordered with the TV and if you wish to cancel you do not have option even they have mentioned we can cancel within 10 days but then you also need to cancel your entire order along with the TV. i suggest dont go with additional warranty with the jeeves consumer protection plan as there is many hidden T&C."

1055,5,Highly recommended,Multiple features available at reasonable pricing. The mirroring/cast option did not work until the Built-In Chrome Cast was updated. Using Google Home from Smartphone is a great way to cast mirror the screen onto the TV.

1071,5,Fabulous!,awesome purchase very happy ..very good picture clarity and sound ...amazing purchase can buy the product with no hesitation
1072,5,Terrific,As i found the smart tv never get in this range... This mi led tv beaten all our needs. but one thing is after update mirror cast not working.. pls correct it
1073,2,Slightly disappointed,Mi LED Smart TV 4A PRO 32 inch tv is good but viewing angle is very poor.
1074,4,Nice product,"I bought this product big billion day offer at 9,999 amazing led smart tv..it's better than other brands.."
1075,4,Value-for-money,"Best Budget Range smart TV, I have and software update with latest Android pie. with HD channels it is a pro.... I Got it in Big Billion Day 😎 at attractive price.. Highlights with new update.. *Vivid picture* *Data saver* *Prime videos* *Neflix* latest Android pie"
1076,5,Terrific,Bindas go for it. Super TV. Prime and Netflix available after software update. Chromecast inbuilt is also very good option. I feel all those who are having connectivity issue must update the Android version as well as inbuilt various softwares. Also those who are not sure about the quality can opt for additional warranty of 2/3 years at just 1200. Even it goes for 3 years full paise vasool. Inbuilt speaker is loud enough and doesn't require additional speaker. Also biggest plus point is Bluetooth connectivity with other device. I used JBL go and Samsung levelU. Both worked fine. P.S. Would suggest additional warranty for everyone.
1077,4,Nice product,"That's my first Led TV, I am very surprised to watching on first time, my all dreams fulfilled. broadcast features amazing, best products for your valuable money.i should be recommending the same ."
1078,5,Worth every penny,mi led Smart tv all over excellent... but wall mount Rs 399 separately paid to installation.Please mi led tv wall mount add to tv box...?
1079,5,Brilliant,1st thanks flipcart for really awsm product in this price. Nd Mi led is very awsm. I m very happy with this product. Must buy. Love u flipcart sale
1080,5,Mind-blowing purchase,I'm very happy for your support and good behaviors thanks so much to Flipkart family...I hope always support every one...
1081,4,Worth the money,Tv clarity is too good and the performance is also good.... But the connectivity and the apps r not compatible to the TV normally...... If its installed its not showing outside..... But the app is showing in app manager.... Poor Android version.....dont know why they r not giving a app for screen mirroring..... There was a separate app for screen mirroring in 32 inch tvs and all apps can be easily used on 32 inch.... But this is a totally different......other than this all is best quality got in offer including axis card rupees 18099 best value for money
1082,5,Simply awesome,"Amazing product.. Worth the price. Boot up is little slower. This isn't the right time to judge, will post honest review after 3 months."
1083,5,Must buy!,"The Xiaomi Mi LED TV 4A Pro is a good buy for those looking to buy a 43-inch smart TV. It has a fluid, functional, and well laid out UI that brings you the benefits of both stock Android TV and PatchWall. The picture performance at 1080p is great too."
1084,5,Awesome,value for money and best product in this price range. i get this tv in 9899 rs in big billion days. awesome features and perfect tv for me.
1085,5,Excellent,Very nice product in this budget. Flipkart is really a nice platform to get amazing offers compared to other E-commerce apps. I got this tv in very much reasonable price
1086,5,Must buy!,mi led smart tv 4a is best tv on smart and lovest pric e in india cg bilaspur sendri
1087,4,Delightful,I ordered this TV in big billion sale 2019 and as promised everything went smoothly including delivery and installation. The TV might not be the best but at this price it comes with a number of features. Thanks flipkart....
1088,3,Decent Product,"I purchased the Mi smart 32"" 4A pro series tv just 3 days before. 1) the picture quality is not that great, because the contrast and LED backlight is set to maximum so the home screen looks more bright whitish, if we reduce the brightness this may further kill the clarity of the display. otherwise it's ok. 2) the sound quality is very good, with 20 - 25% volume it's loud and clear. 3) connectivity: all my devices at home works well with my broadband Wi-Fi connection but not the Mi Tv. I myself resolved by adding wifi repeater. 4) value for money: Really it's not, the LED panel glass is not that great it's thin and delicate with little pressure applied while cleaning it may break. this is not the same case with LG, Panasonic and Samsung. but due to competition most of the LED TVs in the market uses this variety only (China). look out for IPS LED panel presence is good. 5) the TV installation technicians are real joker's they really don't know any thing other than selling wall mount kit stand. they charged me 1800/- but the same stand is available in Flipkart for 650/-. !!! as per them they sell only original.!!!  my overall experience is 3 stars in a scale of 5"
1089,3,Just okay,"The TV was delivered on time as well as the installation was done very well before the scheduled time. Picture quality is awesome, viewing angles are good and connectivity is much more better than I expected.. overall satisfied with the product. However the installation partner Jeeves charged hefty Rs.2500 for a wall mount and I got to know that it is only Rs.500 as per the guidelines updated by Flipkart. Beware of these cheaters and I'm totally disappointed by the way things went.. Totally happ with the services of Flipkart hence 4 star and for installation partner JEEVES it will be in negative."
1090,5,Best in the market!,Sound quality is too good. picture also good for this rate comparing others. But not that much Android apps available and TV cast not stable. over all for this price it is a best chiice
1091,5,Worth every penny,"Well the TV is awesome as it's feeling good to our eyes. It's been 2 days now feeling gud. I truly liked the offer over flipkart. However, the only thing disappointing is the bracket (stand ) for the LED doesn't comes with the TV you get. We separately have to pay for that. Team please can there be changes made for this atleast during festivals and occasions."
1092,5,Worth every penny,"personally recommend mi led it is the best led in the market every things was good the most important my son is so happy with the mi TV he is enjoying, and learning thanks to Mi & Flipkart"
1093,4,Delightful,i was having a sony led prior to this.So i had a belief No other tv has the same quality like sony .But this MI 4A PRO is No less than a SONY.I have been using sony since last 8 years.Durebility of MI is yet to be tested.But as of now the best product avalable on this PRICE range.
1094,4,Worth the money,"Overall the MI LED is an exceptional product. Wonderful picture quality, Perfect sound and awesome product experience. However, the pacthwall and connectivity to OTT platform like YouTube and Hotstar will need a very powerful internet connection if you are using at home. Though it connects with WIFI very well. However, for a better experience of patchwall and other smart TV features a very strong internet connection via router is required. The installation of MI was not smooth as had a tough time with the technician not turning up on time and forgetting to provide proper demo. Had to followup with technician a lot for installation and demo. One less star for the hard time with logistics and technicians."
1095,5,Awesome,wonderful smart TV with additional Google Chrome addition feature.this TV was value for money. thank you Flipkart. thank you mi
1096,5,Worth every penny,Mi tv is amazing and value for money but price's of mi tv down month by month like mobile. Some times i felt like shoud i wait 2-3 month to buy with big savings. Otherwise mi tv is best.

1108,4,Value-for-money,"The TV from MI is absolutely superb, its worth for it's price provide good picture and sound clarity, currently no problms with the connectivity and it's working absolutely fine for me, the delivery and installation from the part of Flipkart was amazing, the product delivered with in 3 days after placing the order and installed on the same day by the technician overalls nice product you can go for it with this price"
1109,5,Worth every penny,good tv mi led and nice delivery and very nice installation
1110,4,Really Nice,Nice product from mi got it for best deal . For single families small families it’s worth buying in our budget.
1111,4,Good TV - Now 4K option makes more sense,"Bought this TV a few months back. At that time this was the best Full HD smart TV at that price point. Today Mi has the newer 4K TV which is offered at only 2K more than what I purchased it for.  The TV has excellent panel which produces good colours and brightness. The sound is alright. The patchwall interface is nothing great but I have learned to live with it. With the limited keys on the remote you will have to come to patchwall to change between sources which is slightly annoying. I loaded Prime Video, Jio Cinema, Jio TV from Aptoide. You can search on YouTube to find out how to add these apps. Prime and Jio Cinema work great. Jio TV app that I installed did not work well.  I feel it is a good TV especially given that the 4K version did not exist when I bought it. The only cons I can point out is the limited remote and the slow boot time."
1112,5,Just wow!,"I'm writing this review after using the product for 10+months. The best TV you can get in this budget. The picture & sound quality is excellent. After last update, the TV gets connected with WiFi & Bluetooth speaker automatically once it is ON. Mi updates the software when necessary. The voice search button, searchs everything and open it in youtube as there is no browser in TV. The play store in TV do not have amazon prime, Netflix apps in it, but you can get them with alternate options. Over all, I just love this TV. Android TV's are future and this Mi TV is one of the best of it all. Go for it 🤟🤟"
1113,5,Worth every penny,"the service and installation was done by Anju Mishra, he is well trained and experienced technician. the installation of tv was done perfectly well and was cooperative too."
1114,5,Wonderful,nice tv in this price segment. very good quality picture. very much suitable if you want to watch dth channels and full hd content on it. there is no issue in tv. problems occurs only if you are end user. for example some of us feel it has low quality of sound speakers. well its a modern tv and has small speakers. so better you get external sound bar or speaker setup for your particular requirement. apart from this I dont know how to connect mi phone with this mi tv without using third party app for screen mirroring. i found option of screen mirroring in my phone but still its not working in my case. well this is not a big issue for me because i don't think I'll use this feature very frequently. so all good for me
1115,3,6 months usage review.,using this led from last 6 months. must say its a gr8 buy although im bit spectacle initially weather to buy or not but at last i bought it. so after using 6 months im reviewing this. pros. 1- all in all value for money. 2- picture quality is not superb but good. reason of rating good is that it lack brightness and more on darker side.. some scenes especially night scenes lack brightness. 3- voice command is also good .. more often it capture right words. 4-having 20 w speaker sound is also good but not recommended for big rooms. 5- personally like the patchwall. cons.. 1- after using 6 months it starting to lag bit between switching one app to another or changing in between videos. 2- not a full hd 3- doesnt support hd quality in prime videos. 4- typing something is nothing short of n task. 5- wifi turns on n off automatically. 6-slow processor. 7- most of the external app not running. 8-volume of the speaker. 9- delay start
1116,5,Must buy!,Service was very good .I give 5 out out of 5. Thank you it care (Jeeves).Arun suresh.trivandrum. timely delivery. Service in current time .
1117,5,Excellent,wow ossume smart TV with very reasonable price with best quality

Its play store content is very limited. apps are limited . you can't install prime videos, Netflix and other usefull apps in this smart TV. then what's the use of this smart TV. I sum how installed 3rd party apps but most of apps does not support TV. I could have given 3.5 rating"
1160,4,Value-for-money,Don’t think so much becoz in this price mi LED is one of the best LED.i highly recommended you to buy this. Thanks flipkart and MI....
1161,3,Just okay,Genuine review. it's a middle class TV. Fine product. But u ll feel plastic. Not the well equipped with stuffs Flipkart brand marq provides good Than Mi4a pro. MOST IMPORTANTLY ITS HANGING LIKE LESS CONFIGURATION ANDROID MOBILE PHONE.   installation person did too much hurry as it was described in installation section he didn't shown demo itself just Insta stand and turned on that's it. he didn't checked the ports also.
1162,5,Terrific,very good product in such price . satisfied for value of price and picture and sound quality . overall happy for getting this product
1163,5,Fabulous!,Nice TV in this price range very nice pic and sound clarity worth to buy thanks Flipkart and MI
1164,5,Best in the market!,"Awesome, i got this @9,000 in BBD with Credit card offer.  truely amazing TV, need to improve UI & if i want to typing any thing is really tough, there should be provision of voice typing or MI Remote App have to provision of key Board that makes all easy. else every things are good at this price range"
1165,5,Brilliant,"The best tv ever at thise prize ,i loved thise great picture quality and good sound"
1166,5,Classy product,Got it within 2 days with installment on the day of delivery i.e within 2 days of order. Am very satisfied with this purchase.

1168,5,Simply awesome,"this is the best one smart TV in 12499, don't wait buy it, I am used after 1 month review ,it's so good value for money,"
1169,4,Good choice,"Very nice product.  The picture and sound quality is superb. You won’t get many inbuilt Apps like Netflix, prime videos, jio tv and cinema. It only have Hotstar, ZEE5, Sonyliv(limited) etc.  For Netflix you need to download APK from google and then install it. Also you need a air remote for operating Netflix.  Further when your air remote is on the tv remote voice Assistent won’t be working.  Amazon Prime Video is also not pre-install or available on play store. You have to download an APK version and install it in TV. However, it very difficult to operate and most of time it gets stuck and you have to close the application by directly going to patch wall.  To operate Prime Videos you are lucky that Prime has cast facilities which is awesome."
1170,4,Pretty good,"It is a good TV to buy at such low price every thing is good except screen cast feature, it doesn't work well. Now I am using it for almost 4-5 months no complaints yet & happy with the product but the installation guy was rude and wasn't much instructive rather he was more into selling his extended warranty stuff."
1171,4,Good quality product,"better quality compare to samsung or lg , amazing sound& display, best part Android love it."
1172,5,Perfect product!,Really happy with the awesome service as within 2 days delivery after order confirmed and same-day installation of TV. Good picture quality and sound quality it is great value for money product.
1173,5,Brilliant,"Very nice service i order it day after yesterday, Order came after 2 days and the Engineer came on that same day so happy thank you flipkart."
1174,5,Super!,Tv works very well. Worth a buy. The installation was very smooth and complete support was given. Technician name was Sagar Nikam. Gave the demo detaild nicely and helped me with details of extended warranty as well.
1175,5,Fabulous!,Ir's really awesome. I purchased it for Rs.12499. If I would have waited for big billion days I wud have got it for 9999 or 10999. This brand has set the hallmarks. Other brands like Motorola and Samsung are also trying their best but it's tough to stand before mi. I wud recommend this to all those who are looking to buy a LED TV at around 12000.
1176,5,Brilliant,over all good product ek dum jhakkash like sound picture and clearity quality.... i suggest only buy MI Brand led tv  i am buy big billian sale in only Rs. 9999/- at 29/09/2019. MI LED SMART TV 4A PRO

1180,4,Good choice,"Thanks to flipkart, timely delivery and installation . mi Led Smart TV 4A very good product , sound quality is very Good . picture quality is super .I m very happy"
1181,4,Good choice,V V GOOD LED IN THIS PRIZE RANGE N ALSO ITS INSTALLATION PROCESS V V GOOD..FLIPKART U R SERVICE PROVIDER IS SO GOOD...
1182,4,Worth the money,"Tv is awesome picture quality is also best but few things are not so good.  1. Pictures quality is good when it has more brightness, if we reduce dark shadows come which is not so good. After reducing brightness it won’t affect for tv Chanel’s picture. 2. Google search won’t work all the time. And it only searches in you tube and application. 3. For this price tv is good and awesome picture quality."
1183,4,Wonderful,Overall good experience. Tv could be more slim but in this price segment it's a far better than another brands. Sound quality and picture quality is good. Need to purchase wall mount externally. Better to purchase mount from market because MI service engineer demands 500 for wall mount but from market you can easily get it in 150-200 rps.
1184,5,Fabulous!,Very good led at very good price super picture quality sound quality very good
1185,5,Classy product,nice product and value of money this product sound and picture quality Good android support easy and connect support super allows super
1186,5,Fabulous!,Appreciating the work by MI👏🏻👏🏻I didn’t expect a TV with this rate could reach our expectations Loved the visual effects and all the things on Mi tv❤️❤️Didn’t faced any connectivity issues. Loved very much
1187,5,Excellent,Best Service by the engineer he was responsive and he was cooperative and he was very comfortable with us.....that was good service
1188,5,Highly recommended,supper product everything is good but sound clarity isnot satisfied not Dolby level &remote isnot good tv. is very good
1189,3,Good,All not good but i would say all best and price is value for money only one thing is installation cost is high just because mount wall is ordinary material which costing in market is very low After 5 day 1500 more discount i m not satisfied
1190,3,Does the job,TV is fantastic quality and sound design everything is perfect but Delivery was not good too late I am very disappointed plz change gati choose another one but Thanks flipkart make me happy that product 😇😇
1191,5,Terrific purchase,"This is a very good Smart TV. Everything seems very good be it picture quality or sound etc. Only thing I have a thought about is the resolution which is of 720p and I think it should have been 1080p but it's the norm these days that a 32 inch TV dosen't have 1080p display. The OS got upgraded to Android 9 the next day of installation. So, it's also good."
1192,5,Worth every penny,best led in android series led & cost effective
1193,5,Classy product,very nice product. MI has given best value for ur money. picture quality is good as compared to same range TV's.sound is good. overall a good tv
1194,5,Must buy!,in this prize range sound quality is good with best clear picture quality. if u hv a good network then it won't be any problem to browse apps.
1195,4,Good quality product,I don't able to make screen mirror properly with stored media it's work properly with YouTube rest of Experience is Awesome
1196,3,Just okay,"Pretty disappointed with the exchange policy of flipkart. They didn't take my old television because of some ""minor scratches"" when it was clearly working in a good enough condition"
1197,5,Highly recommended,Overall TV is good but Everytime we have to select AV mode to view cable channels..it is difficult for old people...so someone should be there to help putting channels every time while switching on the tv.. other than that everything is going well..nice picture quality and sound.. good purchase from Flipkart.. delivery was good in time..
1198,5,Good product in this price Range_Worth buying.,Best television in this price range. Pros: Good Picture quality. Good net connectivity. Sound quality is good. HD Video is truly good on screen.  Cons: Sometimes voice command does not work instantly....may be due to low RAM/Processor. Input method can not be saved hence you have to select HDMI for TV/Video and other connected inputs EVERYTIME. TV connectivity should be automatically but it is missing.  Although worth buying.
1199,5,Mind-blowing purchase,nice led this rate is good for every one I bought Two TV from flipcart 100 per satisfy as now
1200,4,Pretty good,Excellent product  I'm loving it.  It is working very fine. Picture quality is good as expected. I am loving the connectivity and controlling my TataSky through sensy app. Online and offline shows all I can watch. Using the product for 4 months I could not find any demerit. The most useful feature that I wasn't expecting the bluetooth. It has given me full freedom to control the smart TV and bluetooth accessories. I can listen my shows on bluetooth headset and can control the TV from any room via bluetooth remote.  Excellent Product Thanks
1201,3,Does the job,"The TV is pretty good on paper. Works well too but there is a critical recurrent problem that keeps showing up is the WiFi connectivity. A smart TV is only smart if it has internet otherwise it like any other HD Ready TV. And just so it seems, its not just me who is facing this, a lot many other customers are too, he MI forum is filled with similar queries."
1202,4,Delightful,"TV Good .... Cons- This is not directly connected to your smart phone though wifi. U have to Connect it Wifi from a Phone and u have to connect wifi to a another mobile from that phone, then only That other phone can be screen cast to that TV. Lets Example- i have connected TV via Wifi from Iphone, Then i have connected my MIphone to Iphone , then MI phone and TV can be screencast. All the Data from Iphone will be used by TV as it takes all the data during screencast."
1203,5,Excellent,"Excellent smart tv. I had researched for a lot of tvs before finilazing MI smart tv. Mainly I wanted a budget TV that provide smart features. Brands like Sony and LG costs a lot for the same TV, but xiomi has done a great job in producing such a quality product in a reasonable range. Go for it if you want a budget smart tv with amazing features."
1204,4,Good choice,Overall nice tv with all smart features and also voice remote included but just 1 cone is there it take too much time to turn on the tv every time other wise tv is awesome in this price range
1205,4,Good quality product,"rating after 5 days when I purchased date  So far no issue , will put review after 3 or 4 months used  pros  1. Tried hd and full HD clarity, it's looking good visual 2. sound is good and power bass DTS 3. connectivity is as of now working fine 4. installments done very quickly , thanks for Flipkart additional features packwall, Bluetooth  who are all looking for budget led TV with additional features go for MI LED tv 32 inch is best  no cons"
1206,5,Best in the market!,This smart tv is very good sound is good picture quality is good but connectivity is average and on the name of installation they are making you a fool
1207,3,Fair,"I brought this 2 months ago. Product is good with good picture quality, good sound quality. However you can say it's more than average product at Average price. Flaws : a) Picture quality is not superb as compare to other brands b) Remote is very small & very uneasy to operate c) Very very poor response from Flipkart's authorised installation team- Jeeves services. Installation & Demo. engineer don't know even details about functions in TV. When requested for re-demo same person came with same knowledge & says ""TV naya hai to hame bhi jada malum nahi hai. Aap function me jao hi mat"". d) Connectivity issue when connected on wi-fi & while in mirroring."
1208,5,Terrific,osm led with this price features are also very good go for it guys..and installation man was very hunble and polite named manish..
1209,5,Best in the market!,guys just a affordable tv besttt tv ever seen it is having android patch wall... chrome cast very fast delivery and very fast installation..
1210,5,Simply awesome,"Awesome T.V. Sound is perfect. Great deal at a good price.. don't think too much, just go for it..... I'm satisfied with this.. Thank you Flipkart....."
1211,5,Perfect product!,In the price segment! the best Smart TV for sure everything works perfectly fine sound quality is Good picture quality is average when You watch it on SD setup box but flawless in HDMI YouTube Hotstar Jio cinema Jio TV and others work really good the only drawback is that when I cast my mobiles screen on to the TV is Stops casting after a few minutes and I have to reconnect again and again I only found this issue otherwise it's a product You should go for considering the price and performance
1212,3,Fair,Average TV; without an IPS display; viewing angles are very bad; on the plus Chromecast works like a charm. Better Go for Sony or Samsung; MiTV cannot match the former's picture quality; only recommended for those looking for a just functional TV on a budget.
1213,5,Mind-blowing purchase,mi led smart tv 4a pro (32)inch tv is prize so good and best android tv to purchese
1214,5,Awesome,"product is good, it works good if you have good internet connection, screen mirroring is working properly. but need to connect the same wifi with phone and TV too over all good product"
1215,5,Perfect product!,"This TV is really a smart TV. It has wonderful features. And the price of the product is affordable too. In this price I am so Surprised to get a latest brand new product, bigger screen, awesome features, and superb performance. I am very much happy with this purchase.

1218,3,Does the job,TV is very low quality. please do not expect quality like LG Sony Samsung or other brand. it's ok tv that to considering that it's very low priced with having android. I am not happy with picture quality. night scenes are typically very poor. else ok as I made pact with price and I don't watch much TV.
1219,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"Superb TV with best options, loved it and worth to money.."
1220,5,Fabulous!,"product is good, for dth channel better to get hd set top box, else it very low clarity.. other downloaded videos plays better quality.. comparitively good one"
1221,3,Nice,Picture quality is not bright like LG. Very low brightness. Looks like black and white picture. When we go for setting picture will close. After setting only we will the see the setting correcton
1222,5,Great product,"Beautiful picture quality, beautiful sound quality, amazing features at such unbelievable price. Really amazed with the functionality of remote which has only few keys, after using you realise that no other key is required.  I do not have command over technical issues, but as a user I am more than satisfied with the purchase. However, the life of product is also a concern, which i am confident about because of MI's brand values."
1223,5,Terrific,just buy this product it awesome just if want better experience pls order 49 inch or more its better but one is also good for bedrooms and 1RK FLATS
1224,5,Just wow! My parents are loving it!,I purchased this TV for my parents as their wedding Anniversary Gift! My parents are loving it! The best feature is the voice remote which is very helpful for senior citizens ! Now coming to delivery and Installation I must say it was seamless and smooth! Jeeves you guys rock! As promised their engineer came in for installation and demo and patiently taught my parents how to use the remote and navigation! Keep up the good job both FLIPKART And JEEVES!

I'm writing this review after using it thoroughly for 2 days and people who say there's problem with connectivity, I'm sorry but you guys don't know how to operate the tv, THERE'S NO PROBLEM WITH CONNECTIVITY, everything works as promised and Great job by MI"
1226,4,Good TV at a reasonable price.,"Nice TV at a good price. After a week of purchasing/ using it, can say that picture and sound quality is good.

1232,5,Awesome,"very good product this price, value for money service excellent. 2 hour after delivery my TV is install good job and excellent service. amazing 🤗. thanks flipkart."
1233,4,Really Nice,LED is good hd channel looks cool on it. sometimes screencast takes time to connect. go for it or you can go for 43 inch if u can budget could be around 21k because 43 inch varient is full HD
1234,4,Value-for-money,"Good sound, picture quality, and connectivity. Works smoothly for most of the time, sometimes hangs (rarely and mostly during config changes) - you have to reboot in that case.  But if you connect a wireless mouse or any other input device, the google assistant (voice search from remote) will not work. Support person confirmed that this is an issue with the MI TV.  Also wireless mouse is not working with the virtual keyboard (working well with my other brand smart tv), so typing is tedious with remote. Anyway voice search is a little consolation, that is not available with many smart tvs.  Chromecast is a good feature, you can cast from google home devices, even though I use it rarely. Casting screen from mi mobile and windows 10 laptop is also working smoothly.  Remember: wall mount and remote batteries are not included.  Overall Value for Money. Go for it."
1235,3,Fair,Good and nice working... awesome picture quality lower price range. Liked it

Overall performance of the TV is really good till now. and as expected 'Mi' never disappoints in terms of features and offerings.  perfect buy at the price range of 12.5k. Great work team- Mi.
1248,4,Nice product,"Nice Television. It is quite a smart TV. -It has built-in wi-fi connectivity. once connected you can see you tube etc. directly. - Being Android the remote facilitates voice commands, but the TV should be connected, Google Assistant provides all help. So you are spared the nightmarish typing from the remote. -USb pendrives work smoothly.There is a very primitive audio player. - Overall a good television. - Not talking about reliability because less than a month now. - For sync with Mobile you have to use Google Home app and log into Google even from TV. - There is no Mobile to TV image push etc.So I could not view my phone images directly. Mobile connectivity is limited. - Viewing angles are satisfactory. - I could not adjust the picture brightness/contrast etc. while viewing the channel as the remote has very limited buttons. So picture settings you have to do relying on your judgement. - Finally for the price it is a very good package which allows you all inputs - From Dish/ from internet and from usb.  Flipkart delivery was prompt and timely. For installation I had to persue with the agency otherwise I had received SMS of later schedule but phone calls to Flipkart and agency ensured installation and demo as promised by Flipkart. So full marks to Flipkart."
1249,4,Pretty good,"Very good product , fantastically vfm. Those who looking for a budget Smart TV without compromising quality and features it should be a good option., go with it."
1250,5,Brilliant,I really enjoyed this TV.This TV supported to the 4K picture quality and I really thank to the MI team support in case you have any problem call Mi customer care service and quick response I really enjoyed.
1251,4,Wonderful,"I have ordered MI TV around a month ago. Till now it's working great. Awesome picture quality, vivid colours, crisp and clear sound. Being an android TV awesome connectivity. Only thing which it lacks is that it does not support Netflix and I regularly use Netflix. Hotstar and Prime TV are working great with it. Overall it's a great value for money."
1252,5,Great product,very nice product even better then big tv ........if you want tv for your room it is best tv ever in this price range
1253,2,Expected a better product,Picture quality is great. Sound is very average. Software backup is not good .  Most of the installed apps does not work 7 times out of 10 TV has to be re- started for making the pre-installed apps work
1254,5,Worth every penny,its has very good picture quality and sound generally we are spending more then this to get these features. It has Android IOS system through which we can connect the samrt device and watch what we have on our phones ..I just recommend to every one whose buying sumsung and sony led and paying very high they should at least try once.
1255,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"almost mi tv performance is good but some issue in when we trying to connect google chrome cast with mobile some time be chrome cast working some time be it's not working other feature like patch wall,you tube app and mi voice remote is fantastic & other pen drive connectivity ,rc cable ,antina ,dish connect all is good,,,i suggest to people its good for buying & this is the best budget tv in today market than other brand...."
1256,5,Just wow!,"TV is worth it's price. The service provided by the Flipkart Team is worst. Just ask for the installation team contact details for installation process to be quick. Otherwise, you will never get installation resulting in voiding tv replacement warranty of 10 days. Hope, Flipkart work and improve this service.  Amazing Picture Quality if using good internet or HDMI dish TV Good Audio Output, average Other Devices Connectivity and rest of the Features are awesome..!!  Just Missing the Netflix..🌝"
1257,5,Classy product,"screen n sound clarity is nice, wifi connectivity is poor and requires good network strength, overall good experience with #flipkart and jeeves for EXCELLENT support and providing delivery and installation was on priority and before given timelines"
1258,4,Worth the money,product is very good and also good packing & good delivery time.... and good price...
1259,5,Classy product,"It is a amazing tv, i got it for 19999 and its actually worth every penny. Picture quality is ok buy not very good. But as a budget tv, it is the best in this price range."
1260,5,Best in the market!,Awsm In this range picture quality is really impressive and sound is also superb delivery and installation on same day value for money.but its writeen that free installation but it cost me around 650 for wall mountind and set up box stand they have to mention it on top not on the bottom but the wholw experience was just awsmmm😋😋
1261,3,Fair,"The TV is good but I am really annoyed with the mirror device problem, hopefully it might get improved with updates. (Keeping in mind the price) Pros: 1. Sound Quality is Very Impressive.Just a bit harsh at top volume but you will never need it, sufficient sound at low volume. 2. Picture Quality is Amazing. I watched Avengers Endgame at 1080 BR and it looked damn sexy. 3. Optimum Brightness and colour reproduction. Cons: 1. Connectivity for mirroring device is very poor. Other connection work fine. 2. Limited application but Side loading apps is easily workable. 3. Takes a lot of time to Install Apps from playstore.  All ports work just great not a single issue."
1262,3,Nice,"Overhyped tv brand with average picture quality. Go for it only if you want feature loaded tv, otherwise at the same price buy basic LED TVs from bigger TV brands viz; Sony, Samsung or LG that promises to offer superior picture and sound quality."
1263,4,Really Nice,Overall this is a value for money product!!  Got delivery in time and installation done (after few follow ups with customer care)  Do not expect overall quality like Top brands but go for it if you need best smart TV and android features in a budget range.

1295,5,"Nice picture, good sound and really smart TV","Nice picture, good sound and really smart TV at price that is so attractive. Make sure you update software to get all features."
1296,3,Just okay,"used for a week now, overall and average LED TV, picture clarity is not up to the mark, far from FHD, it has serious connectivity issues, keep loosing internet connectivity, keep loosing screen mirror, so it can be considered a normal TV and not a smart TV as the basics of smart TV functions has issues"
1297,4,Worth the money,Very nice experience with mi tv it has all the features which required to entertain. Very nice sound and picture quality. The only problem is that I thought all the mobile android apps are working. But android app like whats app and jio tv app all that apps are not working. Only TV version apps are working and all the apps are waste. Not usable.
1298,4,Good choice,It's good and work superb and in this great price I get smart TV excellent product and the Engineering are come very fast if you need to buy tv then you can buy this smart tv
1299,3,Nice,Tv is awesome and best in segment for this much price.  only thing is that it doesn't work properly when we connect Ir blaster cable with gtpl set top box
1300,5,Highly recommended,Never aspect such a awesome TV superb pictures quality perfect sound. I and my family like the most. Thanks to flipkart for providing such a nice mi TV.
1301,5,Must buy!,Awesome product from MI. Will recommend this with no doubt. Great picture quality and sound as well. Worth money.👍😊😊😊😊 Flipkart delivered the product on time and did the installation.👍 Only thing I was not happy was the way they shipped the product. It was not kept vertically up while transporting. As I saw that the same was leaned towards the side of pick-up van which was tightly packed with a lot of other products to be delivered. This could cause some damages to these kind of products.
1302,4,Value-for-money,"If I say in one word , this mi led tv is best👌 , sound quality is awesome , good picture quality , value for money and the impressive feature is patch wall & bluetooth . U can use wireless headphone for personal use 👌. I will say don't go to other brand it's best ."

1310,4,Really Nice,"Purchase on 17th August. Delivery on 19th August. Installation on 24th August. Installation guy Avijit Dey has less knowledge. During our chat, he started arguing that this tv is android tv and not smart tv. Jeeves, the installation partner of flipkart should recruit some knowledgeable guy. If not, then the same should not be arrogant atleast. Operating system seems to be behaving slow sometimes. Apart from this, everything seems to be fine as of now after purchasing. I would recommend to go for it. It's value for money if you are looking for a budget purchase."
1311,5,Simply awesome,"led is good, plastic of body is not good quality than other companies like lg and sony, best led to purchase value for money"

1318,5,Excellent,"Once again value for money product. Screen is absolutely HD, crystal clear. 3 HDMI ports 3 USB port Bluetooth pairing option , aux and AV support  All in one pack plus it’s android TV means you can install apps on this TV.  Till now I am only facing issue with activation voice command , I will do some RnD n figure it out as it’s common issue with MI smart TV , yes it supports google assist just like our android phone and it has chrome cast inbuilt so playing YouTube and other Aps only requires internet.  Overall it’s a must have product  Sound is wow , till now I kept volume level to half and my ears are satisfied , cant imagine what will happen if I keep the volume to high ."
1319,5,Terrific purchase,"I really liked the mi tv 4a LED TV Flipakart's sarvice is nice too, but I find the gati curier chi sarvice too lazy, they can't deliver in time but everything else is nice .. Thanks."

1341,5,Brilliant,thank you MI for awsome TV at this price but dnt trust Flipkart with there exchange product policy... Flipkart wishmaster won't take your old perfectly fine working TV and will state that your old TV is defective..dnt trust their exchange policy

1343,5,Great product,impressive this product and good price but I don't like the installation tech not work properly
1344,4,Nice product,"Absolutely a good buy. Have been using it for 2 weeks now and it is good and simple. Picture quality is good and if you need best quality you can connect to you tube and watch. Even sound and remote is absolutely fine.  However as everyone else was complaining, the Jeeves guys are just waste. They comes to you with a bunch of things and asks us to buy. They will scare you buy saying, take the costliest wall mount extend the warranty period and even they have stand for your STB. Anyway other than that they don't know how to connect WiFi or update the patch wall. Anyway I have connected and updated the patchwall myself.  Other than that, TV is just awesome and I got it for less than 12000. I hope it will last long."
1345,5,Super!,Nice product at very reasonable price. Thank you so much Flipkart for your prompt delivery.
1346,3,Does the job,tv is good but not support many apps & almost useful app not found in Google play store is not a Google play store  every time to connect sources not set default remote also not found source key and voice command also not connected the sources

1348,5,Mind-blowing purchase,Excellent TV for the price. Viewing angles are decent. Sure there are better panels but for a smart TV the performance per rupee is great on this thing. Excellent living room TV.  downsides : no Netflix support yet which sucks
1349,5,Terrific purchase,Great picture quality at this price range. Awesome sound quality with 20 watts DTS speakers. Wifi connectivity is up to the mark. It has the youtube pre-installed which i like the most. Must buy TV....
1350,5,Wonderful,Dolby digital video and sound hd quality and 2k support mi LED TV 4a pro is best india and other brands not qualified good only mi is good
1351,3,Does the job,Stand below led tv screw is not poper. no wall mount i 12500 rs. no brightness or contrass adjustment setting awailable. no batree cell in remote. only good for tv for pc its not suitable brightness adjustment option not there..
1352,5,Terrific,No other tv is as good as this tv at this price. Beautiful performance. If u r thinking to invest money on this then go for it don't think so much. U will love it
1353,5,Worth every penny,best in the market...picture quality is awesome ..sound quality is amazing ...connectivity is smooth....overall product is too good and never the less price is too valuable..
1354,5,Awesome,all things is perfect but but but the person who came for demo not familiar with tv control and we give 400rs for wall mount but not done perfectly its slightly down from the left side all service was awesome from flipkart
1355,5,Awesome,best smart tv i have not seen in my life amazing fantastic mi tv at this price range is bestest of all
1356,4,Value-for-money,I am very satisfied with the MI tv which i have purchased. I have got all the specifications that I was looking for in a smart tv with less budget. The picture and sound quality is good. Connectivity is also not an issue. Yes you can be satisfied with this smart tv only if you have a good internet connection above 6 mbps. I do not have a set top box but can watch movies through some apps on internet. I am very much satisfied with this smart tv. The main part is the MI customer care is also good. If there are any minor issues then the problem is solved on the phone itself orelse they send their technician at home. People who are looking to buy smart tv in low budget can definately go for this tv.
1357,5,Must buy!,super fast delivery by Flipkart. Best TV in budget. Must by if you want great TV in budget
1358,5,Worth every penny,"good sound is very good and other features is also very good under this value only picture quality is not good if you compare with other brand like LG, Samsung etc , overall TV is good and value for money."
1359,4,Very Good,"worth every penny you spend great picture quality and viewing angles superb sound please stay away from brands like Philips, Videocon gave one star less due to wifi limited range and constant issues use a lan cable for connection and your good to go."
1360,4,Good quality product,"I am writing this review after 5 month so it is very much helpful for new buyers. I purchased my MI TV in March and delivered on time and delivery people are too Good and helpful. TV Picture quality is excellent, sound is average need improvement. working is fast and I am very much happy. value for money. BUT TV DOESN'T WORK DURING UPDATES AND Local CUSTOMER support Team is worst. During TV update , full day it is not working so I called customer care and got appointment of local technician for next day 9 AM, BUT NO BODY CAME FOR SERVICE UPTO 72 HOURS OF COMPLAINT , FINALLY I CALLED A PRIVATE LOCAL TECHNICIAN AND ISSUE IS RESOLVED AND HE CHARGED 500/- ."
1361,4,Good quality product,"This TV is value for money.. I have Samsung full HD TV, which was brought 4 years ago at 36k.. obliviously it is better than Mi.. But in terms of price point Mi is better.. its quality also not bad... another thing I have noticed, MI TV have Android version but Samsung come with their tizen version.. but my opinion Android is better than tizen.. in android all application arr are available.. now, the cost 32"" Samsung smart tv is 17999/-, but it comes with 4gb internal, but Mi come with 8gb internal.. but in terns of picture and sound quality definitely Samsung is better... one thing also noted that.. if you want to this MI tv fit into your wall then you may pay extra 399 for wall mount.. but instillation is totally free.. but if you purchase from Flipkart then mi will not provide any installation sevice, but Flipkart provide service with free of cost.... This tv is better than Mi LED Smart TV 4C PRO in terms of display, other all are same... thus conclusion is it is a value for money... if you want to purchase a tv under 12k then you go with this..."
1362,4,Worth the money,"pros- 1) Android smart TV at 10500 rs very cool 2)sound quality is too good 3)built quality is also good cons- 1) picture quality is not up to the mark..it's just HD TV. 2) connectivity is not that handy...u need to do lot of circus...as such their is no direct screen mirroring option.. 3) they won't give wall mount inside the box & u need to pay extra during installation ( one more thing,kindly avoid ordering other wall mount from Flipkart,just pay money to the installation guy for wall mount 400 for fixed wall mount & 1400{it's actually costl} for rotatable one otherwise installation guy will simply create problem saying that the wall mount u ordered is not up to the mark so if anything happens to TV we won't be held responsible and all..& ur warranty might get violated..bla bla blaa,so better avoid other wall mount)  verdict- if u r looking for tv under 12k,then go for it..if ur budget is more,then u can go for some other full HD TV.."
1363,3,Nice,TV was awesome but the installation service-man was not good and not proper install the my setup-box connection on this TV and this man was get the charge me total 700/- rupees for a simple stand to on my room wall.
1364,5,Excellent,Smart tv with good picture quality and also have so many feature with low price. This is really amazing. Thank you Flipkart and Mi India for this amazing product. Full Paisa wasool products 😊
1365,4,Value-for-money,"Good picture quality, fast connectivity, easy Remont access, best Segment in this Price Go for it..."

1370,4,Worth the money,Wonderful product with in pocket value.... Feeling good to place on orde at Flipkart.... Good deliver time.. As well as installation done before giving time period.....  Sonio like every thing very much..... Must buy....
1371,5,Classy product,"TV got delivered before the promised date, kudos to flip-kart for that. Now coming to the TV, yes it is smart.  Pros:  * All the smart features. * Prompt delivery. * Brand installation within 24 hours. * 720p display. * Sound is fine.  Cons:  * Takes time to turn on ( I know this is a android system so it'll take time to turn on like an android smart phone ) * The star rating label is pasted on the display, and it can't removed simply, this is bit annoying (still unable to remove the sticker).  That's it"

1379,3,Decent product,"The screen quality is absolutely good and the sound is awesome. But if you looking this TV for android. you wasting your time. you cant open google also in this tv there is the selected app which you can download from play store. The android means is you are free to do anything. but on this TV you can only download selected apps which I dislike most. and the play store is totally different which I can see on my phone. I can use this tv to only with cable connection but if I look into an Android Tv this is not gone what I expected. MI have good products and i like they have budget products. but on this Tv I am bounded to download apps or things. THANKS, Mi"
1380,5,Super!,"At this price point, it's a steal. If you use Mi or any Android phone, then you don't need a demo. The UI is so user friendly & intuitive that the UX is great. Excellent product."

1383,5,Super!,"On time delivery by flipkart(by delhivery) without having to wait for long and installation and demo was also done within 2 days(by Jeeves consumer service). Very satisfied with the delivery and installation. I would like to point out one very imp thing for normal tv viewers regarding the pucture quality. Most of you might be aware that the normal SD channels will not be clear in HD television. The SD channels(that we receive from cable operators and dth providers) will be very clear in older televisions but will look blurred in HD television. We need to upgrade our cable tv or dth package to HD for enjoying the full benefit of a HD television. So far very satisfied with MI tv, excellent value for money. Will rate regarding smart features later."
1384,5,Must buy!,In the use of this tv my review for this product is so attractive. It's a awesome product in this price. I just loved it. And it's sound quality is too good. When you hear it's sound you feel like you are in a movie theatre.

1408,5,Perfect product!,"This TV is suberb. The picture quality, sound, features, everything is perfect. Actually I feel that we are very lucky that such a product has been launched by MI. For a middle class family with medium budget, it is perfect. I had kept this TV in my cart for about two weeks. However, I've realised that there's no need to worry. Just go with it. I'm 100% satisfied with it. Many many thanks to the company and Flipkart for giving us a premium experience in a medium budget. Just buy it while there is an offer of 1500/- less."
1409,5,Best in the market!,Awesome picture quality is superb. Android smart TV in this price segment is unbelievable. Flipkart service satisfied the installation with in time completed . But this is my best TV. I like it.
1410,4,Really Nice,"The TV worth every penny, great picture quality connectivity and other options. If you are buying an Android TV please ensure you have a good internet connection as well other wise it's of no use. with internet and an HD TV channels it's an ultimate option.  the best part I love is Chromecasting your utube video in to the TV. Once you Chromecast ur video you can start using phone for other things and change the screen from Utube but still TV plays. also you can ad Google Home to control your TV.  after a month of usage.. it's still good but it does not support HDMI ARC I have tried all the options in internet but doesn't connect to my Sony HT-RT3."
1411,5,Simply awesome,"Smart TV in less budget, awesome picture quality, connectivity expect sound quality. Should rectify the sound quality as it is not audible clearly!! otherwise value for money!!!"

1413,3,Good,the power rating should have been 5 star and the Bluetooth should have been 5.0 it would have been great although its good not great
1414,3,Does the job,"2 weeks after using this I can happily say that the biggest USP of this product is the pricing.  Picture quality is a bit disappointing & Sound quality is sad, infact the Bass is appalling. plus they don't support Netflix, NOT YET, I'm presuming.  the phrase ,you get what you pay for ,is apt in this context.  This TV is recommended in case you're looking for a good technology at a Cheaper price,  I would advise that in case you can spend a bit more YOU MUST LOOK AT LG OR SAMSUNG as a far far better options to what a Smart TV should actually be.."
1415,5,Perfect product!,"Really, If you are looking smart TV in affordable price. So this is best one.. I am using this TV last 2 months. Performance really fantasticWa.."

1452,5,Perfect product!,"I was a bit skeptical before purchasing this TV, but it turned out to be a good purchase.  Price: ( 9/10). Its a great TV at this price, but I am only giving it 8 because the price fell by 1000 a week after I purchased this item.  Built: (8/10). I was using LG Tv previously and could actually see the difference in build quality. LG Tv was much more durable and had used much stronger material. Even the back panel was completely sealed, unlike MI Tv where you can see internal lights and wiring from the back. Having said that MiTv is also not that bad. The frame looks fine from the front and is not very delicate. Also, given that there is a price difference of around 10K between LG and MITv, I feel its a good buy.  Colors and Contrast: (9/10). A lot of people had pointed out that there are certain issues with brightness. I actually did not feel any. Just turn off the backlight and it works fine. The colors are also nice.  Connectivity: (9/10). The connectivity is good. It provides a wide range of connectivity options like USB, wifi, ethernet, Bluetooth. I did face a little problem with casting and bluetooth connectivity. The casting would stop midway and sound in my wireless headphones would break. So I connected my TV directly with router using Cat6 cable ( which cost Rs.120/15m). I haven't faced any issues with casting since then.  UI: (8/10). UI is pretty good. You can actually go for Pitchwall home screen or MI default homescreen.  Pitchwall: (2/10) Almost all content on pitchwall is paid.  Apps: It has a lot of apps available on playstore. And those not available on playstore can be installed via usb. ( Hint: You may encounter an error while playing certain videos through USB. Do not panic, download MX player from the store and they will work.)  Delivery: On time delivery  Installation: Same day installation.  This is a great buy Tv at this price range. Go for it."

1477,5,Classy product,This Mi led is a great Tv in today's modern era . It is full of features . It is a very good product by Mi and it is cheaper from other led . Why to waste money on the expensive led if u get all the features in a Mi 4a pro.

Only one cons. that the installation team didn't come to install! instead of that SMS always came that the installation team wanted to contact us but couldn't reach though I myself rang him up and asked when he is going to come, but after that he never came. One pro is worth mentioning that the delivery boy himself unboxed the TV and showed it to me before taking the electronic payment. Nice thing."

1486,5,Great product,"if you want to buy a 32 inch LED smart TV then don't think twice, just buy...  this TV has all the latest features which are available in the market 2019 and the best thing is you are getting an Android TV at this price.  This TV exceeded my expectations..."
1487,5,Classy product,Awesome product... Loved it... Today i received my TV n connection done. After few days will give a final review but at first look I found it superb
1488,5,Just wow!,mi led is very good value for money its have a superb display and awsome sound quality
1489,5,Perfect product!,"Excellent quality comparing to the price. Sound is megablock buster means sufficient for medium hall. WiFi connectivity is not accurate but good, we have reconnect after several hours. Overall value of money."
1490,2,Slightly disappointed,"Though brand, quality is as per the price but popular apps like prime video and Netflix doesn’t get installed even with aptoid TV work around. Wasted so much time there. Even other apps like JioTV aptoid versions post installation you have to log in every time. If you are ok without these apps issue and want to watch through a set top box and don’t need a smart TV having basic apps it’s your choice. I didn’t like it."
1491,5,Brilliant,Really amazing picture quality and it's sound also so good. Mi LED TV really awesome. I am very happy with it.
1492,4,Wonderful,The only thing lacking in this product is a full hd 1080p panel. If MI can provide 1080p panel in this size then i would have rated 5 stars. Sound quality & clarity is better than most led TVs in this price range. Chromecast and patch wall works flawlessly.
1493,4,Nice product,"Picture Quality is good.. Sound quality is very good. Delivery and installations were done on time.  Connectivity is the main pain point. Normally its works fine but sometimes it is unable to detect even a 50 Mbps connection which leads to Youtube getting stuck and ultimately youtube app crashes.  I too had the same experience where i got a call from a random guy saying i won a tata safari in flipkart lucky draw or i can collect corresponding cash. That guy had all the information like which tv i bought, my address, pincode etc. This is something that flipkart needs to take care as customer's information is getting leaked to fraudsters"
1494,5,Classy product,superb led liked it and hd quality was tooo good
1495,5,Must buy!,I would have been given 5 for connectivity but what to do I have some network problem... so lil bit lag in connection... otherwise every penny worth if u are going to spent ur saving.. 1.picture quality will be seen if u re in hd pack of dish 2.sound quality perfect... there will be no need of buying speakers.. bcoz it gives a perfect sound like the feel of home theatre effect.. 3.tv means a lot to us tat too a smart TV in this budget... very happy
1496,5,Best Smart TV by Mi,"By past 3 weeks of usage of Mi 4A Pro 32 Inch. Pros 1) Good display viewing experience. 2) The Patch wall Interface is good. 3) The smart remote is good , voice search works very well. 4) Good sound experience. 5) Good connectivity options , Ethernet, Wifi , HDMI, USB all works well.  Cons  1) Nothing"
1497,5,Super!,Wow super I am happy nice products
1498,5,Awesome,"totally worth for money. go for it instead of costly Sony and Samsung tvs. sound is great worth of rs. 6000. picture is good but not as 4k. totally smart TV with Google assistant remote , take time to start. overall amazing performance in just 13000"
1499,3,Nice,"After one day use, this is a best android tv, best picture and sound quality. You tube is a best function of this tv.."
1500,5,Terrific,nice tv nice to see I am happy 😍😍😍 Awesome tv 😍😍
1501,5,Wonderful,I am reviewing this product almost 1 year.my tv panel was damaged in warranty period but they change the panel and give me the new panel .panel quality same this tv is amazing and tv service is very well ..all is well go for it mi best tv ..but but installation days mane time 2 days wait for install ..but enginer is very nice guy....behavior is very well ..
1502,5,Best in the market!,"Smart and affordable. If u r buying a smart tv for the first time, please feel free to buy MI TV. Good image display, excellent 4K display, little slow, Value for money"
1503,5,Perfect product!,The TV which we orderd after its delivery it's felt like the trust and faith of the people for Flipkart is on the right way and Flipkart once again proved its worth the tv is amazing picture quality everything is just so perfect value for money -5/5
1504,4,Worth the money,Timely deliverd.... picture quality 3/5 not best ..still not use internet ....very good TV in this price range ....But Jeeves service very very bad ..always messages but not come to anyone install TV at last I call mi and they install TV ..Thank you very much Mi ..next time I buy mi store ...Flipkart must be action Jeeves
1505,5,Simply awesome,simply super with this range of price . clarity is good sound is good . we can connect YouTube through mobile no buffering also.screen sharing from mobile is available.
1506,5,Terrific purchase,"Nice product, best in this price range, can comparable with this size and spec product range with very less price. And best value for money product."
1507,5,Must buy!,awesome Android smart TV picture quality is superb Just awesome !!! Great package at great price. Value for money.
1508,5,Good Choice....,"Guys, I always big fan of Sony and I used Sony TV's for more than a decade. Now it's turn to adapt for the present trend and chosen MI TV as I have been using MI mobile from past more than a year. As expected MI TV is amazing. It has very good picture quality. You wouldn't be getting any TV in this price range. I am happy to purchase it. WORTH for PRICE and go for it If you are planning to buy. Installation is also done very promptly and demo is impressive. Thank You Flipkart.."
1509,4,Nice product,Nice product... Fast delivery by flipcart...Just one think i want to share installation by JEEVES is very bad...Not satisfied for installation and demo process..Please need to update for satisfied customer..Wrost installation process..
1510,5,Simply awesome,"The picture quality & HD resolution is fantastic also the sound is too good in low volume as well. The best value for money product. Installation guy was also very helpful, asked me to record all the procedure for further assistance. 5/5 rating."
1511,3,Does the job,Honestly its an average Tv.... According to the price yaa you can say it's good and worth but you cannot expect a sharp pitcure quality i'm a kind of satisfied with it.
1512,5,Worth every penny,nice product just awesome Mi led Smart Tv
1513,5,Perfect product!,I finalised this one after a lot of research I have done for over a month. I say its a value for money. you can definitely go for 40 inch model but the only difference is 32 inch model has a resolution of 720p and 40inch with resolution of 1080p. I suggest you all to first try to search the difference between google certified android tv and smart tv. Yes you read it right there is a huge difference between the two. Consider it before making a choice👍
1514,5,Excellent,The product is fine and am totally satisfied but it took them more than 15 days to deliver the product to my pin location and its really very disappointing... But afterall the product has the ability to gain five star... Thnx😊
1515,3,Okay TV,Okay TV. Not the best in the display. Fast shipping. Display not comparable with Sony but okay for this money. The authorised service person took one day for installation. sound is sufficient for a room of 11X 12 sq.feet. It needs a strong Wifi for continuous connection otherwise gets disconnected.
1516,5,Highly recommended,One of the best products I have ever purchased online.You can blindly go ahead and purchase.sound quality is superb..!I love it.But for fitting the product nobody visited me as I was not available due to a surgery.when I contacted the service people they said free fitting is not there as I have crossed their time period for free fitting so I have to pay ₹800 for fitting.So be prepared for the service guys as they may not serve you better
1517,5,Simply awesome,"It's a very good Android TV , connectivity also superb Full Paisa vasul product I love it it's worth for money"
1518,3,"Good Product, NOT GREAT","Delivery on time but installation is way too slow(Took 3 Days after Delivery). Product is ok, I have 3 Samsung TV also and I can easily say that Display is not better than Samsung but it is good considering that this TV is 10K cheaper than Samsung. In short, if your Budget is tight then go for it but if you can stretch your budget then go for Samsung. P.S. Netflix and Prime are still not available for this TV."
1519,5,Awesome,Absolute wonder for this range... Go for it. Best android smart tv ever by Mi. And ofcourse flipkart delivery and installation will never fail to satisfy you.... 👍🏻
1520,5,Terrific,"Picture Vibrancy good , sound quality amazing for this price and good installation and demo. Pretty amazing we can get a TV for this price . Normal mount costs ₹400 Good Adjustable mount costs ₹1500"
1521,1,Horrible,"quality of products is too bad. very less bright ness . we can't increase contrast, bright ness . sharpness. connectivity very poor . MI is the real CHINESE product. after brought this you will feel. this is the reason there is no cancelations only replacement . after replace you will get same product. i check with technician . quality is very poor . don't believe chinese product and supporter like flipkart. after purchase you have to use or throw ."
1522,5,Worth every penny,all is fine but installation man is not good & I suggestions mi company give the mi TV wall stand free not is cost is 500 rs. why 24000 rs. purchased the led after 500 rs. TV wall stand purchase in installation man . mi company say purchase the led & free the installation but installation time company boy take a 500rs why this a cheating
1523,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"Best in smart TV.....amazing performance with great picture quality awesome viewing angle, sound quality is also good.....and easy to operate"
1524,5,Mind-blowing purchase,The best smart tv with so many features the best tv each and everyone can afford
1525,4,Pretty good,Nice TV. picture quality is good. compatible with dish connection as well as through internet also. U can do screen mirroring in ur MI TV with ur smart mobile through app but need wifi connection.
1526,5,Wonderful,"People complained about the picture and sound quality. But after customization of settings, I have excellent picture & sound. Watch videos on youtube regarding this & accordingly change the settings. Delivery & installation was also done on time as promised. Satisfied with the TV. Purchased in mid of June 2019, in August got upgraded with Android 9 and further updated in September 2019 with vivid picture engine. It is value for money. Very happy with the experience."
1527,5,Highly recommended,"In one word, you can't get better product at this price... 1. picture quality is great... 2.sound quality is awesome and loud (to be frank, you won't gonna increase volume to 50% even)... 3. connectivity to wifi is fast... no issue faced yet... builtin Chromecast is great... you need to connect your phone and tv with wifi to use Chromecast... (It's not a con, as google Chromecast is built in this way) 4. Remote is connected via Bluetooth and also have IR. So, you can operate your tv from another room too... 5. TV will have more than 4GB free space to install your apps. 6. Ram is 1GB but it's enough for an android tv.  Go... grab the tv...  Had some issues with installation... and my installation got delayed. My installation was rescheduled twice by jeevs. Flipkart must look into their installation partner."
1528,5,Must buy!,Best value purchase. Good pic quality and sound quality is good but bass is low. But overall rating 4 out of 5
1529,4,Value-for-money,"The TV takes a bit time to switch on. Also, screen mirroring doesn't work properly on the TV. otherwise, it's a value for money TV. I will recommend this TV to those who want TV for a temporary base."
1530,3,Nice,product is good ... Jeeves service and installation is not good ... charged un kowing charges towards during installation ... technician was looking over confident on his works and slang language Flipkart on time delivery Thank you ...
1531,5,Simply awesome,"Value for money product. if you have a good internet connection like Airtel or Act, go for this eyes closed. Hotstar and YouTube are a plus. user friendly operation."

1537,4,Nice product,"This TV is one of best TV in the market,which have a very good picture quality (but no where near to Sony and samsung and only if we consider the price at which it is being sold).Sound is loud for small to medium room but bass is not there. You have to install additional soundbar for perfect sound. Connectivity is very good all things are working flawlessly.If u have some extra bucks then buy a Sony or Samsung Tv.But if You belong to middle class like me and have a desire to have a TV which have all the features of a premium TV then go for it blindly.It is best the thing that your money limited can buy."
1538,5,Best in the market!,"Best android tv you can get in this price range. Awesome product according to my point of view. Connectivity is very user friendly and its a very good product i should say! If you are planning to buy a smart tv, then you should go for this mi android tv.

1550,4,Wonderful,"Yes its value for money tv. Good Things. ● picture quality ● sound ● connectivity option ● responsive remote (it works on Bluetooth) ● good manufacturering quality.  Bad Things ●HDMI cable And wall mount not comes with tv. ●This is advanced version of 4A. But some features like customize screen saver, wallpaper ,etc. are not available in 4A pro which is available in 4A. ●Cromecasting is too much slow when using mobile net. ●every time when you start tv you have to select source to connect with setup box."
1551,5,Fabulous!,This TV was a great feature for money and a great picture quality thank you for MI LED TV 32 INCH once more thank you for your flipkart.
1552,5,Mind-blowing purchase,Excellent product; Very Fast Delivery and the next day completed the installation. Good picture quality and sound. Very worth in this price.
1553,5,Perfect product!,thankyou flipkart for timely delivery and installation . it's a nice product in this range if we compared with other TV. Picture quality is very good and we are positive for future support also.
1554,4,Really Nice,I have brought this TV on EMI and is working fine till now...the picture quality is good but not as much expected..it's good for the amount. Bluetooth connectivity is slow. Switch On and Off of the TV is taking a bit long as it's an Android TV... For average usage this TV is good
1555,5,Great product,"I bought this as a secondary TV to put in the 2nd Bedroom. Hence I was on a budget - 12k was a perfect price. I do not have a cable connection or STB at home for either of my TVs. I totally rely on Wifi to stream online content via Netflix, Prime Video, Hotstar & Zee5. I have a 100mbps broadband which is more than enough to stream on both TVs concurrently. THis TV stream content pretty well. The TV is primarily used by parents to watch evening shows & its perfect for that purpose. Being an Andriod TV helps a lot. I can mirror phone & even cast easily. OS can be a bit slow sometime but thats okay for the price. The BT remote is lovely."
1556,5,MI LED SMART TV (4A PRO),"Good product and good packaging.  First time use the remote will not be connected so use the switch underneath the power light to turn it on and then connect the remote for future use. Of the pack the color system is bit fade, so change the color proportion as per requirement. TV is awesome and Google play now works in this device.  Delivery wise its really quick and good.  But the representatives sent must be educated on how the exchange policy works, like how to ON the other TV and so on.(Because of this i couldn't exchange my old TV and its still in my hands and had to pay extra 2900 for the same.)"
1557,5,Terrific,very low price and super product. Tv body is so slim and comfortable for daily use. So good quality of pic of this tv and wish to buy again from flipkart. Thank you 'Flipkart'.
1558,3,Nice,"Picture quality in channels are very poor but you tube videos quality are full HD.... And Picture colours setup is not available in setup function. That was very bad for pictures colour quality. Sound quality is very average... No more function in sound setup like bass, 3d surround, woofer etc.... Wifi connectivity is good perfome... I suggested to Mi Led brand... Please work on picture & sound quality bcoz they are main part of Tv... Without HD picture & sound we are not enjoying to watch tv... And plug cable of Tv is not removable therefor coustmer is not easily change after plug wire were damage. After all Mi Led Tv is very average perfom by my opinion..."
1559,5,Just wow!,"It's a wow TV. I never thought i will buy Android bTV in cheap rate. But it got possible by Flipkart. I would like to big thanks to Flipkart, installation was free & fast by jeevas. 32"" TV is a best for small family."
1560,5,Super!,connect hd set top box to enjoy hd quality. you cannot enjoy with sd set top box. and all in all it is value for money product.
1561,5,Terrific,"what a tv in this range.. and what a flawless connectivity with Bluetooth, wifi, Chromecast, screen mirroring.. and playing from pendrive of any kind of file format.. and through hdmi 1080p videos or movies, what a awesome experience.. love mi.. lots of love flipkart"
1562,5,Just wow!,"Value for money in this price range I am using this tv since one week and having amazing experience, All you need is good broadband internet connection super fast connectivity amazing sound Moderate picture quality and most amazing thing is google voice search just one click and you can connect with mobile"
1563,5,Highly recommended,"Friends, I m writing after using my mi led smart 4A Pro (43) one month. Friends this tv has awesome picture quality n sound effect, although it is full HD but it can run on 4k quality. We'll on otherside it's android feature u can't open ur derised URL because Googlecrome or any other search engine facility isn't provided by this TV. Some in built good apps is provided, Google play also provided but all apps u never download."
1564,5,Classy product,"I have ordered for my parents, they are happy and very easy to manage and operate.  Unlike- Fire stick and Google Chrome cast as add-on to LED TV require some technical know-how ..  Mi has Everything in-built , the beauty starts when you pair with Mi Phone , Mi Mirror added super value to Mi Smart TV  This is called disruption of Technology."
1565,5,Excellent,this is one of the best product purchases I've done till date. the quality of the picture and sound is absolutely amazing. 1080P YouTube videos look damn near perfect. the use of Dolby audio just enhances the experience further. the connectivity is also damn near perfect for the price. I have my tatasky stb connected to one HDMI with my PC connected to the second HDMI. there is still room spared for one more HDMI device and av connectivity. the inclusion of usb ports is also good. this deal is amazing and just go for it blindfolded. just be sure to check for updates after the first time setup. MI has released a update and it enhances the performance of the UI firther. the WiFi connectivity is also amazing. the inclusion of an ethernet port is also good. I have used ethernet connection as my router is just below the TV. if you have a router close to the TV use ethernet to reduce latency which occurs over WiFi. otherwise WiFi connection of this TV is also damn good
1566,5,Terrific,I am using this t.v. from last 20 days. fully android tv. Great picture quality.. Very much satisfied during World cup cricket season. It is bit thick. from the wall after the wall mount it takes lots of space. Sound quality needs little bit improvement. As my room is quite bigger. In connectivity it takes some time. Over all it is excellent product at this price range.
1567,5,Fabulous!,awesome LED TV with full of features and amazing android TV features in affordable price
1568,5,WOW PRODUCT IF YOU WANT TO SEE YOUR OWN DREAMS IN THIS TV!,"Everyone, please pay attention over here! This is a gem product if you wish to see your dreams come true in the TV itself! You will be much more success to see this TV. Your employers will give you promotions after seeing you with this TV and give much more bonus every year and will be so proud of you if you are employed with them! You will be a celebrity if you are the owner of this TV. You can also throw this TV from the 15th floor and it is unbreakable TV. Press and media will follow you around to meet you after you buy this TV and you will be viral in short."
1569,4,Pretty good,"it's more than a smart TV for less than smart TV price, better than some branded tv of the same class"
1570,4,Really Nice,"Giving feedback after usage of almost 4 months.  TV is excellent in terms of usage , new interface user friendliness and overall TV picture quality display & sound.  Pros  1. Excellent display quality on set top box / HD channels 2. Over wifi display fluctuates depending on internet flu cations. 3. Sound is above average 4. Brightness is average , TV not to be placed close or opposite to window , otherwise reflections will make viewing slightly less fun. 5. Blue tooth and casting is seamless   Cons 1. Very limited apps on play store for it [ No Netflix , Amaozn ] ."
1571,5,Excellent,Writing it after using it for more then one month. Picture quality is good but sound quality is ok. It is not clear on high volume. Lots of connectivity options are there and interface is quite easy to use. Google Voice works like a charm. Built-in Chromecast is there and works like a pro. One downside that you need internet connection to connect to Chromecast and to cast anything in TV. Overall a great product and value for money option.
1572,5,Just wow!,"I bought 2 Mi 32 TV, it's Android easy to use, Google voice recognition in remote, fully advance smart tv in reasonable price. Lovely and wonderful tv I bought,.  5 star for this TV, hope MI will launch AC soon in India."
1573,4,Delightful,delivery very slow by flipcart also behavior of courier is not good picture quality is good sound quality is not much better connectivity is very good easily connect to mobile  behavior of installer is good plz keep fast delivery flipcart
1574,4,Really Nice,"Mi TV 4A Pro Review After 3 days of use -  Pictures :- Pictures Quality is good. you can watch best quality in HD set up box and HD channels. No brightness issue, you have to adjust custom display settings. watch from some distance for good experience.  Sound :- Sound is not impressive. Speakers are loud but sound Quality is not like LG or Sony tv.  Smart TV Features :- This tv has Android 8.1 Oreo, You can Play YouTube, More Entertainment and other apps are available on playstore.  Screen Cast and Connectivity :- You can Cast your smartphone screen only with Google Home App, which also Required internet. This is not good as compare to other brands tv which provide direct screen cast without any app. Remote is good, comes with Bluetooth connectivity and Voice assistant feature. No Wifi connectivity issue.   Delivery and installation service :- Delivery is Good but installation is scheduled to next day but again rescheduled and done on 4th day after delivery. you have to wait for installation and before installation by company you can't self unbox or install it otherwise Replacement or warranty not provided by company, informed by flipkart customer executive. i called flipkart care for installation issue but they tell me they can look in to complain and provide solution after 5 days time. This is worst as they required 5 days to look only for 1 days installation issue. finally installation completed on 4th day, technician was good and experienced bt not expect quick Customer support by flipkart. on this place offline market shops can provide quick installation better after sell service and support."
1575,4,Good choice,"Firstly let me get the bad out of the way. Sound is loud enough for an average room but not for a large living room or hall space. It also lacks bass. Now coming to the pros. Connectivity is good and everything. 1080p or 4k videos bring out the picture quality but understandably don't expect eye popping clarity on normal TV channels (non-HD). The best thing about it is the price-point. You possibly won't find any better options in this budget. Xiaomi service providers are always happy to help and well behaved on calls. A great buy all-in-all. Also Flipkart installation was very quick, they came the next day, but the behaviour of the person was inadequate or kind of bad by my standards."
1576,5,Worth every penny,Awesome tv..go for it without hesitation.. super delivery on time nd next day only installation done by Flipkart n the installation guy was very friendly Nd behaviour is nice..
1577,5,Just wow!,in this prize best tv and flipkart services are very good fast delivery and same day installation nice work flipkart
1578,4,Pretty good,it's my First led TV after using gov TV the TV is good enough for the price Picture quality is awesome in this price range with android os I've noticed some lag and software plm I hope Xiaomi fix this in future updates every one should try this
1579,5,Highly recommended,very nice LED smart TV by Mi .. and very good service.
1580,4,Really Nice,I made a Good choice for myself....looking for a smart TV with my low Budget & I found MI fits in my criteria. 1)Good display & viewing angle. 2).. Play android games using mi remote .3) quick WiFi connectivity. 4) great sound when u plug USB & watch ur favorite thing. 5) Nice UI. 6) Overall Happie with the product.
1581,5,Best in the market!,Chrome cast is good but Screen mirror is not well even at a distance of 1 meter... Screen quality is good it even supports 1080p videos but not support AC3 format audio... Pixel quality is also good at SD channels and sound is quite lound of its 20watt speakers...
1582,3,Just okay,"Nice TV but connectivity is not very good.... needs dedicated LAN port to watch videos, shows on OTT platform like Hotstar, Zee5, ALT Balaji etc..  Picture & Sound quality are excellent and perfect..  Good deal for Rs.17,500/-"
1583,5,Highly recommended,very good deal in 9989 rupees and it's working very nice I love it nice deal from flipkart
1584,3,Just okay,Does not meet expectations  It's is very good LED TV from Xiaomi but only on paper.In actual use you will find many issue in screen it's screen can not process good picture quality while you have a HD Set top box and HD channels.it's not matter which quality use have switched you always see a picture quality like 360p.its not worth I suggest you do not buy this LED TV but you can buy ifaalco LED TV instead of mi LED TV
1585,5,Classy product,It's a very good budget tv . Its connectivity is very good and everything seems good in a less price
1586,4,Really Nice,good clarity and sound Dolby audio it support screen cast and support phone and play with any usb media
1587,5,Must buy!,Product is awesome and value For money. Everything is good but i am not able to connect my phone by screen mirroring. At starting phone was connected but after that it's not responding. Kindly solve this issue.
1588,5,Terrific,"Flipkart service is the fastest one.I am utterly satisfied with it about all aspects n service installer named Pradip Mahajan(Jalgaon,MH)who was helpful,polite n expert in his work.Mi led tv 4A Pro seems the best tv at par. I am speechless about features of the tv n in time service too."
1589,5,Terrific,Best in range ... actually it's smart TV.....Work very well in high speed internet... awesome
1590,5,Terrific,Really it is the best smart tv.application like jio tv is not working properly.It needs some software improvement. but overall it is best. Just go for it.
1591,5,Wonderful,"Fast Delivery TV is good (picture quality, sound quality & connectivity wise) Installation guy was friendly & explained all the features properly! Value for money  Working properly as of now!"
1592,4,Really Nice,This tv is very good but only problem is that its picture quality is not so good otherwise it the best tv that can be bought in this range.And i will advise you to buy this because you will not get any other smart tv in this range.
1593,5,Simply awesome,awesome product good clarity sounds superb tq mi an thanks to flipkart
1594,5,Worth every penny,awsome product. this is full package in this price. non of TV is compare this in its price range.. I suggest u to please don't waste your time and money in any product directly buy this. i am so happy and satisfied with its results. please this is my opinion this product seriously deserve 5*++++.
1595,5,Mind-blowing purchase,Best product in this range. Mi wins the heart. There is no other product in such an affordable price.
1596,5,Mind-blowing purchase,TV is awesome but some time issue with connecting from WiFi But This price range This TV Is Good I like the Chromecast build in in this TV that is very good feature Awesome TV
1597,5,Excellent,"Value for money. Nice TV. Installation done by next day of delivery. Installation guy was very polite, well manner and decent. We are very pleased by his behaviour. Lovely TV in this budget. Thanks MI."
1598,4,Very Good,Bought this @ 12999/- Delivery was quick - on the 3rd day after ordering. Installation was fair - the installation guy came the next day after delivery . he didn't explained anything much on the usage or settings pretending that the users know everything or rather he did not had any knowledge.  I connected it to chromecast first which was real quick and played some videos on wifi. The hd videos played from wifi/internet are perfect and sound was pretty amazing. however the real test was to check it how the non-HD stuff works especially the non-HD TV channels. I wasn't expecting much from it but to my surprise that was pretty fair. Now this wasn't the best or some would say crystal clear but there is no distortion and it is really worth at this price.
1599,4,Value-for-money,"I recently purchased this TV and it's awesome,Not happy with installation services. this TV really worth the money but Android updates are very few.if you want to enjoy Android TV must buy atleast 10mbps plan otherwise you will not get that much enjoyment of internet."
1600,3,Just okay,"If you expecting Good SMART tv then don't buy MI, they do not have support for media apps. even preinstalled apps won't work sometimes"
1601,4,Really Nice,great product Loved it chromcast is litel bit uneasy to use or it is not good up to mark otherwise it is great television just connection with phone mirroring is not up to mark everything else is great nice picture quality sound is good Wi-Fi connection is lil bad connection first connected as no internet then have to wait 1-2 minutes to get it going
1602,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"This LED Android Oreo TV is amazing. Just update your television when you start it for the first time. Actually, MI has introduced an update which will resolve all connectivity issues related to Wi-Fi and Bluetooth and after this update this television works flawlessly. This TV is total value for money and much better compared to Sony / LG / Samsung which are charging so high in same specification. An update is around 800MB including system as well as application. Jio TV application works fine and there is no lagging. HD channels are superb. Kindly, note this 32"" inch has a resolution of 720p but can also play 1080p by downscaling video quality and your eyes won't be able to differentiate between picture quality. In SD channels the red colour effect is little bit more which appears to be artificial but in HD there is no such issue. I am writing this review after 10 days of usage. So, those who are planning to buy it, then go for it."
1603,5,Must buy!,Perfect smart tv at this price......... brilliant picture quality and great sound....... connectivity is slow....but good....for casting
1604,4,Very Good,"when I saw tv after unboxing. it's stunning  very light in weight as compared to i had one of Toshiba 32 inches led. first impression +- =】 why I bought this ???  but when I connected tv then its navigations, performance and picture quality is very good comparatively its price. please do not compare with Sony. but still you can compare quality with medium range leds of LG and Samsung. You will nothing compromise except brand name. anyways if you get warranty then there is noting matter. everything is use and throw afterwards  pros - less price and more features  cons - plastic quality all around cheap. including table top stand included inside. no wall mounted stand available. need to purchase externally.  but overall good with price."
1605,4,Good choice,"Picture - at this price it is good but couldn't compare to branded TV Sound is good, but for songs I felt voice and music clarity is not there connectivity and other features are good as of now"
1606,4,Wonderful,it's an amazing led tv and flipkart service is also very good and the service engineer avdesh kumar is also a nice person.
1607,4,Value-for-money,very good picture quality and also sound quality.....Bluetooth connectivity is good chrome cast works fine bt with internet....tv is very good in this price.....most value for money....i am happy and installation fast and good....over all good....
1608,5,Awesome,"At this price, I don't know what better can be asked. Great budget-buy. Display, clarity, sound and bass are all up to the mark. And the Android on top of this is a gem. Voice-enabled by Google Assistant takes away all the pain of typing on Youtube and playstore availability means all OTT video streaming apps are available for use.  In short, this is a value-for-money product and I'm lovin' it."
1609,5,Must buy!,awesome product at this price... totally satisfied with product.. patchwall is working great and lot of content to watch.. sound and picture quality is excellent...watched 4K videos without any issue...delivery was quick and installation was smooth and happened before one day than committed date...

Decent Tv. good picture quality. good sound as well. amazing price. not as feature rich ui as other smart tvs. but patch wall is good too. for basic usage its awesome. Thanks to MI for a good product at unbeatable price.  played 720p, 1080p and 4k videos on it. picture quality remain the same. so did the audio. base is bad at higher volumes.. but remember its a tv not a stereo system. connection to a stereo or external speakers for sound quality enhancement.  played games via ps4.. it was flawless. hdmi link works but not very accurate. very simplified remote. can be controlled by smart phones via androi tv remote app."
1611,3,Good,"Remote cell missing, demo of product is not up to satisfy because the engineer is not checking USB, Hdmi and RG port are not checked.

You wont get dissappointed,"At this price the TV is amazing in all aspects. not fantastic but very good product, 4k is playing well , nice color reproduction, with a HD display and an android os over miui whatever you expecting will be there in this TV. wifi connectivity also good. youtube and all inbuilt apps are working fine. didn't check with extra apps, but the internal storage is very less(for this price i should not say this) only 4.5gb available for apps. brilliant smart TV.

1633,4,Worth the money,really a best 32 Inch smart TV. people those complaining about setting input every startup may update the software. and select input settings and choose stay with previous input. For good brightness please off dynamic brightness. sound is very loud no need of external speakers. screen mirroring is not butter smooth for hd videos. For wall mount may be purchased from flipkart costs Rs.160.
1634,4,Worth the money,"Review after 1 week use: TV will receive a 750 mb android OTA update, whenever it connects to the internet. after that , There is option for hdmi autoplay. Cons: 1.If we connect a normal external stereo speaker via 2.5mm jack and When we play a video with 5.1 audio , The sound from the speaker will be low, even after the volume of tv is at its maximum. (this ia because of 5.1 channel can't automatically converted into 2.0 stereo). But the issue can be fixed by listening from TV speaks. However there is no issues while watching TV channels or videos with Mono/Stereo audio. * Netflix&Amazon Prime apps are not available , neither can't install from usb(wont work). Can be play via a browser.   Pros: *Pictures are Crisp and clear *Built in Chromecast is very useful * in USB Playback,almost all format video supports after installing MX Player *Playstore support * also can download apks from internet and install directly to the TV *Aptoid app increases the TV app availability  Overall , Value for money."

1655,4,Worth the price - room for improvement and software upgrade,"Definitely worth the price your pay for Pros - reasonable price, picture nice overall. Large screen with 4K quality. prev one had a dead pixel in a couple of months and TV unit was replaced. Cons - Sound. an external sound box is required for good sound quality feel. Remote - no mute button No way to shuffle between programs (swap channel). one ha to go back all the way to start another program. a feature present in all (non android) TVs and is a must. Software up gradation should be provide to allow for this. Wifi- chip needs improvement. mobiles have much better wifi chip."
1656,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"Good sound clarity and visuals, totally i like the product. added value is that i can able to connect the TV with wifi"
1657,5,Excellent,"Tv is really good for the price, u dont need internet connection to use cast screen all u need is a spare router or a hotspot phone. viewing angles are good too.best thing abt tv is its remote cintroller if u like google assitant u are going to love the short cuts of it"

1663,4,Nice product,"No doubt this MI TV is extremely one of the best TV at this range but still I felt that there should be qwerty keyboard behind the front face of the Remote... picture quality is excellent and all other functions runs smoothly only while connecting it with Wi-Fi takes time and sometimes when you re-start the TV, the Wi-Fi connection gets loss...connecting it with any Bluetooth device takes little time rest everything is perfect in this product... Be it whatever..... best TV so far..."

PROS : •Wifi connectivity is too fast, which means lesser buffering. •Picture quality is good •Side Loading of third party apps •Aptoide works flawlessly CONS : •Sound output is little less"

1673,3,Decent product,its screen size is small compare to other 32 inch led tvs . . . its not look like 32 inch tv. .its sound produce a beep sound while going to next channel . . . and its picture is over bright so we can not see proper color production . . .

1675,4,Picture Quality is not too Good,pros:  Good Quality Sound. Marvellous. Numerous features. Perfect Smart TV  Cons Picture Quality is not good with Non-HD cable connection YouTube Videos quality is great. Picture quality for 32 inch TV is as expected for a 10 x10 room size. Don't expect Crystal clear Picture.
1676,5,Excellent,MI LED Very Excellent Good Flipkart Service wow Installation Good pay 399 Installation Very Excellent
1677,5,Worth every penny,"Grabbed it in 20k in an offer on flipkart. Timely delivery & installation. Good picture quality & sound. Truly, loved it. Thank you flipkart & MI"
1678,3,Just okay,The tv looks great and have amazing features. Also you will get lots of free contents with voice search. But there is a issue with viewing angle. It will not good if you are trying to watch it from side as the pictures seems whities. So for this I am slightly disappointed. Otherwise TV is good value for money.
1679,4,Good choice,"it's 1 week from the day it installed .. working good , but the pixel quality is not that nice . good view in 4K movies"
1680,5,Excellent,"Its been long since purchased. Working absolutely fine. Upgraded to Android 9.0. Picture quality- Perfect Sound quality- Perfect, Works best on youtube, pendrive. No use of any external sound bar or home theater. Remote works very well as it is connected via bluetooth so can take command from any angle, no need to point. You can connect MI Ir cable for single remote functionality, worth it. Its fully recommended. Value for Money."
1681,4,Delightful,a very good of mi. flipkart is providing a great deal on mi product. jeeves installation is slightly delay. it is completed 10 days after delivery of product. overall it's a great product.
1682,5,Must buy!,"Excellent Service from Flipkart and delivery within 3 days of purchase, Installation & demo from Jeeves company they installed within 1 hr from delivery.  For Mi  I recently purchase this Mi Tv it looks good, picture quality is good and sound quality is awesome. Very nice product in this price."
1683,5,Terrific,"1) product :- 1st time i ordered tv online so i little bit doubted but this tv just awesome best picture quality, best sound ,best connectivity . 2) installation :- installation guys are best +5 🌟 for that🙂 guys go for it... 3)after 2 months of use this tv connection prb some times😑"
1684,5,Perfect product!,Best SMART TV ON FLIPKART in budget category. Picture quality is excellent with good quality sound. Connectivity options are very good. Great value for money. Got it for 20000 in flipkart big shopping sale
1685,5,Simply awesome,Fine and best in class. Service engineer who installed TV could not connect remote and could not start TV. then he told that service engineer will visit tomorrow. by this time I connected mouse in USB and TV started. later I learnt that remote is a Bluetooth device. I started TV Bluetooth and remote got connected. thereafter I am enjoying TV with LAN connection. no cable or dish antenna required
1686,5,Terrific purchase,"After 2 months of usage, I am writing this review. This is an awesome TV, my entire family loves it. Picture and connectivity is excellent, sound is ok, Android is gr8, it has a Bluetooth remote my kids love to using it. Thanks to MI and flipkart. I love it."
1687,5,Super!,Amazing Product for such an amazing price point. Flipkart just made my day with a great value for my old tv exchange and Bank offer that made this tv around 9K price range. now we have connected it to our phone and YouTube was never that clear and amazing.
1688,4,Really Nice,"The TV is really good value for money the connectivity of network is good you can connect it through your Mobile hotspot the voice quality of the TV is good as well the effect of picture is normal not so vibrant..but average overall experience is appreciated fast service by flipkart, the only thing which is unbearable is that the service that is provided by flipkart like the installation process fitting of the TV etc is not yet done, it's been a week I have bought this smart TV home but till now I haven't got any service of Installation, very disappointing. Talking about the television it's overall a very good piece worth every penny, don't give it any 2nd thoughts goo for it."
1689,5,Mi t.v,It’s wonderful n the sound quality is very good n high picture quality is hd n the service level is also good i m very happy with tha product..
1690,5,Perfect product!,it's good & value for money but I don't know about the durability of this product but current time it's best in rest available market option.
1691,3,Fair,The TV reached me in good condition and delivery was done well and good. The installation was done on the next day after continuous follow ups with the assigned agency. Well the TV box was suppose to have 4 nos of screws for the stand but to my surprise the screws were not there in my TV box. Also the batteries of the remote is not included.
1692,3,Just okay,honest comment... 1) Pictures are dull as compared to other big brand led tv. 2) Sound is not clear. 3) Frequent connectivity loss. 4) Difficult to install and run outside apps.  But overall...if you are thinking to just have a TV for next 3 years and change to better one...buy this one..for 18k I can't get much. So 3 star is best suited for this TV.
1693,4,Delightful,nice product best TV the rate of middle class people helpful flifcart thank you
1694,5,Fabulous!,"Using a smart TV for the first time and Mi TV is so exciting to play around with. It's sleek, trendy, feature rich and a perfect value for money product. However I felt that the remote could have been more comprehensive to key in."
1695,5,Brilliant,"Awesome TV at Very reasonable price  It had y everything you want, except sufficient apps in play store. We have to install Apitov TV store app to find needed apps. I suggest you guys to develop TV apps as much as possible.  Everything works great apart from that. Thanks MI"
1696,4,Good choice,Great Tv...The Best value for price...quality best in the price range...should improve the ease of navigation (for not so techy users)
1697,5,Just wow!,one of the best android TV in this range with this big screen. Casting is a problem sometimes but still better than other TV's. other than this best TV right now in this range
1698,5,Simply awesome,Value for money product this price segment and TV is so nice and installation are very good I'm so happy thank flipkart
1699,5,Highly recommended,"very good product worth money, also happy with the installation services by flipkart.  overall loved it."
1700,5,Mind-blowing purchase,The picture quality of TV is amazing & loving. The sound quality is decent but not impressive as pictures & color of TV. The MI TV4A Pro is best in this price range. I am satisfied with performance of TV.  Flipkart should improve its installation service. The technician was much arrogant & didn't install the TV perfectly & moved immediately after hanging the TV on wall without giving demo.
1701,4,Really Nice,"I got the TV in big shopping day offer, it's amazing and thanks a lot to Flipkart, good service and next day i got installation too, zing zing amazing service by flipkart, keep it up"
1702,4,Very Good,Excellent TV at Excellent price.. Delivered in 1 day.. but the installation and demo is very slow.. they came after 3 days for installation.. but the person who came for the installation is so nice to us and helpful.. I'm very satisfied for the product. but they should improve their installation process..
1703,5,Great product,MI LED service is super and installations is very good the dealer Appocrh is very good
1704,5,Awesome,fantastic TV good quality product and picture quality very fine song quality very fine all over all find cheap and best price
1705,5,Awesome,the best tv in my life I love it might is the best not only for mobile it is good for every thing I love mi
1706,5,Super!,Mi LED TV 4A Pro 32 sports a 32-inch HD ready 60Hz panel with a resolution of 1366×768 pixels. It features two 10W speaker modules and runs Google’s Android 8.1 TV with the company’s own custom PatchWall UI on top.

1707,5,Just wow!,"Overall best for features, Picture quality is best totally enjoyable with cute remote and functions.."
1708,4,Pretty good,I am order mi led TV on 15 may 2019 and delivery on 21 may 2019 delivery it's so late but installation in under 5 hours is good and picture quality is good but sound is ok .
1709,5,Classy product,very good tv.with wonder full features👍🤠.Guys go for it.its an awesome product from mi🤩 value for money😎.include with somany hidden fetrs😈.compared to samsung disply clarity little low🙁
1710,5,Awesome,"really awesome product, I'm happy with mi led smart TV with Android."
1711,5,Great product,it is very good led tv in less price then other. Flipkart delivery service was also good as it is. and also next day installation was best.
1712,5,Simply awesome,T.v is fantastic I love it at this much price it is best Tv i got. Thanku Flipkart.
1713,5,Super!,I am writing this review after 2 days of intensive usage . the picture quality is amazing (You can run 4k videos in YouTube) Sound is above average connectivity is amazing and the software as well as the hardware is amazing
1714,5,Awesome,"superb Tv at this price range but u must have HD set top box if u continue with SD channels don't buy it, at SD set box Tv doesn't given good filling"
1715,3,Decent product,"this is the best tv i ever had,very good price range with very detailed hd clearity nice sound nice remote operation,worth it,,osm"
1716,5,Great product,Value for Money Definitely and patchwall OS is way better compare to using Google interface. Sound Quality and network connectivity should hv been better in terms of hardware as my phone has better wifi range from same place.
1717,3,Good,Feature rich on paper but not smart enough as a TV.  Pros:- (1) Patchwall experience (2) Segment leadingconnectivity features (3) Decent Speakers  Cons:- (1) No Netflix (2) No Prime Videos (3) Inbuilt chromecast doesn't support casting of Netflix (4) Very weak inbuilt Wifi receiver (5) Inbuilt Bluetooth transmitter has compatibility issues (6) Playstore of this TV lacks apps availability (7) Non IPS screen at this price point is a real bummer  Pls note:- Properly working side-loadable versions of Netflix and Prime videos is still unavailable for these Pro-series tv's. Versions than can be sideloaded till date are either partially working or has a horrible UI experience to say the least.
1718,3,Just okay,"Picture quality could be much better, even HD channels don't impress much. Sound is okay though but a TV without Vivid picture is not worth it. Flipkart delivery has been impressive for the first time in my association with it. Installation service could be better in terms of explaining about the features of the product, it was prompt though."
1719,4,Wonderful,Best TV in the price range Good picture quality Cons it says it comes with 8gb of storage but actually it has only 4.4 GB of usable internal storage I had to cut a star for its sound quality we won't hear the dialogues properly
1720,4,Pretty good,"Good TV at the lowest cost. Only drawback is you have to choose source input everytime when tv goes ON like AV1, HDMI1 etc. TV sound is also good but you have to adjust TV sound level every time. Otherwise awesome Android TV."
1721,5,Great product,Awesome tv no black issues wifi connectivity is great 4K vedios looks jaw dropping i gifted this to my mom cant tell the excitements... Sound level awesome home threater like... Chromecast is damm easy & great buy without any doubts mi will wipe out sony Samsung soon 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍just loving it flipkart services can be better but its ok... Playstore is there as well u will love it
1722,5,Just wow!,I liked everything about the product.Everything worked fine for me.... Amazing
1723,2,Bad quality,WITH IN 2 YEAR GOT COMPLAINT 👍IM NOT SUGGEST MI TV FOR LONG USE 👍 GOOD FEATURES AVAILABLE BUT CHINA IS ALWAYS CHINA 👍 2 YEAR USE ONLY .. LINES ARE NOW IN DISPLAY 👍 MY SUGGESTION IF YOU HAVE MONEY FOR SERVICE YEARLY TRY THIS BRAND
1724,4,Good choice,Excellent tv image and sound super body gud protected screen easily fitted on my existing wall mount . screw hole distance is 4inch x8 inch m6x20 screw size is req . works fine with non hd setup box too. was installed within 24 hours. however the installation guy was not competent as he didnt fit tv on my existing mount which i had to do it.
1725,4,Nice product,"The tv is amazing at its price , picture quality could be better but considering price point we are getting Android operating system and amazing sound and picture quality is also acceptable. I will definitely recommend this tv under 15k. I am disappointed at one point that if you want to buy a new remote it will cost you Rs.3000."
1726,4,Good quality product,it very nice TV good condition valuable for money. pictures quality good .sounds effectively nice. can the the mi tv in flipkart it great delvery it on time it amazing

1730,5,Clarity is superb,Very Nice Product in very less amount. Clarity is also superb but i forgot to take Additional warranty on this product. If they will provide me now then i can surely take this.
1731,4,Nice product,"Great TV . colours and picture quality is awesome , Speakers could be better , voice search is really great feature and works perfectly , cast screen is also very nice . Installation was late , but this TV is best in this price ."
1732,4,Very Good,Good tv as in good price with all good features... Jst one thing u cant project your any android phone witv tv easily...

1740,5,Best in the market!,TV is Awesome and Very Nice in range of 25K ...Finally I have taken good decision to Buy MI as compared to Sony we need to invest double only for the name sake. My sincere thanks to MI and FLIPKART. Receive on 08MAY19 & Installed on 11May19.
1741,4,Does the job,"no proper guide on phone, remote is not working,,,, when I called to customer care, they replied as this is not our part....

1744,4,Good quality product,i have been using this Tv since 1 week and is working very good.. sound and video quality are very good.. there is no other Tv in this range which is even close to this MI TV. some apps are not compatible with this version of android like Netflix and all and few video format like avi are not supported but there are workarounds to resolve these kind of issues.. to summarize this is a top notch value for money product one can have
1745,4,Wonderful,"Awesome TV..HD Channels clarity very good, Normal SD channel clarity good. sound too good & there is no connectivity issue. I can very easily connect internet with mobile hotspot.. finally got a good TV with all the benefits.  Finally flipkart delivery was on time but for installation we will have to be very patience with some Engineers..  Got my superb TV at just Rs 19599....Thank you flipkart."

1747,5,Awesome,smart TV with affordable price and much better quality... totally satisfied with the product.....
1748,3,Fair,there is no mirror cast in this tv . only Chromecast is available .. for mirror casting we no need data .. but it is not available in this model .. with the help if Chromecast we can mirror our mobile .. but we have to use our hotspot data .. better go mi 4a model which doesn't need data to mirror device.. picture quality also no good as mi 4a ..
1749,5,Buy this TV it's Best but don't Buy in Exchange Offer,"Exchange Offer he was chit to customer.

1753,3,Decent product,1)Product is good with advance features. please go for it. 2) Installation vendor is not punctual in his work also the Flipkart unable to support to customer in installation part because they don't have control on their vendor.
1754,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"I am very happy with the product , no need to hesitate to buy this product trust me you will definitely loved it."
1755,5,Super!,"After one week of use i found mi led samrt tv is amazing for this price. it s an android version, good picture quality, sound quality etc. except that there are some probs which are mirror casting is not working and there is no default connection source. For every time when we start we need to select the source which we need to play, that s a big fault. installation and demo was nice and totaly free of cost."
1756,5,Highly recommended,If anyone think about to buy MI 4A pro led tv i personally recommanded to buy this led.. Great picture quality and better sound in this amount.. If you use high speed wifi and HD set up box you really enjoy HD picture quality... Full paisa vasool
1757,4,Worth the money,"This tv is really value for money but don't expect too much from it......Premium brands like LG, Samsung, Sony and Panasonic charge more because of their picture quality. These brands have IPS Panel which produces good picture quality with better contrast and deeper blacks whereas budget brands like mi, tcl uses VA panel which is okay but not good as compared to IPS panel picture quality"
1758,5,Excellent,amazing product this is my first led tv which i brought my 2nd salery and my mummy and papa so happy and proud of me . thank you Flipkart and mi ..And last thing this tv is very very nice product..

1760,4,Pretty good,At this price it is an awesome TV. One thing need to improve is chrome casting. Overall I liked it.
1761,5,Classy product,"Main thing is that it does not support Netflix. Mi Led is best in this price range. You can't find any type of competition in this price range. It is best, but The wifi connectivity should be more better. Mi should be work in wifi connectivity. Overall Good quality"
1762,4,Good quality product,"Feature rich tv, best in the category. Would have been great if it had 2Gb or more RAM"
1763,5,Terrific,a best tv for middle class family because in this rate you got SMART Tv. nice sound and pictures quality.
1764,5,Highly recommended,wow nice price superb tv i like it tq mi
1765,5,Wonderful,Wow awesome product is good very happy
1766,4,Wonderful,Awesome tv... Truly smart.. Good picture quality.. Good sound... Good connectivity... Only pros... No cons... Not to forget chromecast... Works like silk... Smoothly.. No lags within 5-8 mtrs range.. Which is what you use in a home..
1767,5,Terrific,"I bought this tv with a lot of research and a lot of apprehension, but at the price point it is the most attractive tv on offer in market, with Flipkart service at it's best the whole experience with the tv had not only be hassle free but very good. tv screen and display quality is awesome only issue or kind of refinement required is the sound quality. but overall satisfied with the product and service from Flipkart"

1769,5,Awesome,"Amazing product by Mi, please don't down the quality in future. Sound quality is very nice I loved it thank you Mi and flipkart for this nice product."
1770,5,Totally worth the expectations and doesn't hole your pocket,"Don't have words to describe this TV... After much homework and wait i bought it and it is a total worth for money. Even after enough deliberations if this TV is there in your final 2-3 shortlist, go for it blindly... You are done for at least 4 years till a whole new hardware/software technology takes over..."
1771,5,Mind-blowing purchase,What a great led??wow. Mi is a fantastic brand and superb service??I buying 4 LEDs in 2 month for me and my friend's??? thanks mi?? thanks Flipkart
1772,4,Good quality product,Features are good. Clarity is upto the mark not much good.. It slowed after update.. overall good at this price range.  Installation was worst. He did not install tv at proper height after been guided multiple times and asked for money.. tried giving him even the money but rudely asked for more..  Even called him couple of times to re-install but did not come and even receive the call..
1773,4,Pretty good,Its nice Android TV with FHD support ( Smoothly runs 2K videos ) Panel information shows its a 720p display Better to Go with New model with 4K support and latest software Its wifi connection is buggy n supports very low range
1774,4,Pretty good,"Nice pictures quality, nice features, and sound in hearing good, and android features good, connecting with mobile, awesome features. Kam kimmat mne Bada dhamakaa. Feeling good about it."
1775,4,Really Nice,"I am using it from past 3.5months. This product is awesome at this price. everything is satisfactory - audio quality, video quality, internet and other features. WiFi, Bluetooth, Ethernet, USB, HDMI, RCA almost every option is available here and making this product best for use. (+5*)  The audio range is different for Set top box video and Internet video. There shall be an option to increase the RAM and internal memory so that internet can run smoothly if more apps are installed in future or anyone want to store movies/videos (I don't know if its possible with this model). The only shortcoming i found that the remote doesn't have numerical and alphabet buttons, making it almost difficult to type, if you are searching something on internet. (-1*)  Now how long this TV will work like this without any problem i don't know, means product and service quality will be known only in future. till date its working fine."
1776,5,Must buy!,very good product at an affordable price. User friendly. Worth for money. Very good picture quality. Sounds can be much better.
1777,5,Simply awesome,"fabulous TV and Great delivery by flipkart, delivery at right time and after two hours of delivery installation team call me for installation and came after half and hour and installation the TV.. GREAT EXPERIENCE....Totally thanks to flipkart"
1778,5,Wonderful,"Personally under this price range this is the best TV I have ever seen, all the features are good except it's refresh speed 60hrz. Except that Mi 4a android tv 43inch is the best!!...."
1779,4,Nice product,"I liked the product but sound quality was not good & the SD chanels were not working well😣. HD Chanels are average. but if you play videos via YouTube or applications present in the TV then the quality is fine..... yes, you can also play 4k videos in it with the help of youtube only if you have a strong network connection....."
1780,5,Must buy! its Awesome excellent features.,Led was good more update after used one month but i got disconnect when you watching movie or other things via connect by your mobiles . program got stop in led but in mobile movie still running.there are still face problem.
1781,5,Wonderful,picture quality is fine.sound quality is very good.easy connectivity with mobile using chromecast.screen mirroring worked like a charm.voice search worked very well too.overall the TV is a very good tv at this price.Its almost one month now didnot face any issue.only thing for concern is the jeeves installation service but once i escalated the matter with flipkart cust care the tv was installed that day itself. It would be better if you buy the wall mount from outside market it hardly cost 250 but jeeves guy will take 399 for the same.
1782,5,Awesome,It’s an awesome vfm tv.... wit best features... m happy after purchase... but a small tip... don’t mount this tv opposite ur window
1783,5,Terrific,Given the price range...its absolute value for money....picture quality is nice even though it's hd ready... sound output is very good... connectivity options are adequate with 3 hdmis but little hard to reach by if it's wall mounted....and I opted for 2 yrs warranty....so setback relax n enjoy...above all the smart remote is cherry on the top...works like charm....Go for it if want a budget smart & android tv at a very very affordable price...costs less than a budget smartphone....cheers
1784,5,Worth every penny,"good tv and picture quality is great, mirror casting is quite poor, sound quality is normal, need some base, YouTube, and other app works better, easy to connect with internet, a good option in this range,, u should not expect more than this, overall king in this budget"
1785,4,Good choice,it's amazing with is UI but need improvement in sound it's working in DTS but didn't feel as much.....I am waiting for update to change sound quality....it's better and value for money go a head.
1786,4,Really Nice,I'm writing this review after watching four days Sound quality very good Picture quality is too good HD channels picture and sound quality is awesome..

1798,5,Classy product,"I have been using LG 42 inch LED TV with Videocon d2h HD connection and believed that is the best picture quality but stunned with MI LED TV 4A pro turned to be astonished. be it color or black and white. Sound and picture is absolutely great using YouTube.wireless connection is easy , shared Mobile internet making it hotspot. only little confused with SD channels clarity. It's best buy at the price on Flipkart. planning for a 55 inch now"
1799,5,Fabulous!,"good products mi led smart TV, and good sarvise filipkart, and delivery boys , and good sagestion provide from installation boy, Thanks Filipkart,"
1800,5,Wonderful,"Using since 5 days, and pixel clarity is super, and android OS is good with Oreo update. Anyhow TV OS will not support each and every app like phone OS to download, but it will meets our requirement. 4K videos are playing with fine quality of screen space.  Finally great TV with this price with Android OS"
1801,5,Highly recommended,Amazing picture quality. best in this price. sound is enough for large room also. go for it. Installation person explain everythinng about how to operate and mount on wall.

1805,4,Pretty good,The product is Value for money. Good Picture quality and sound in reasonable price if u r thinking to buy a smart TV.
1806,5,Best in the market!,"Value for money spent. Impressed by it's performance. Timely delivery and technical support. Plenty of scope for further improvements in the product with respect to audio/video, input/ output."

1809,5,Fabulous!,thanks Flipkart today I received mi led smart TV Pro fabulous awesome
1810,5,Worth every penny,I recommend its value for money  Pros  1. Picture quality is very. good 2. Audio is okay for mee 3. It's prowered by Android 4. HDMI ARC 5. Done installation in the same day 6. Value For Money   Cons  1. User interface is hard for older people 2. No digital out to connect older Audio System 3. Ify Bluetooth Connectivity 4. Dosenot support Dolby digital sound while watching movies or TV channel 5. Supports only DTS HD or DTS Master while watching movie dosenot give sound in older DTS formats 6. Required restart to work ARC 7. Dosenot support all ARC unit even it's compatable ARC unit
1811,3,Good,Good but not best. Good sound. picture average. FHD hota to thik tha. Mirroring is good. Overall good performance in its price range.
1812,5,Worth every penny,the great value for money smart tv. only one prblm no optical audio output option in tv. really loved it
1813,5,Worth every penny,It's an Amazing TV in this Price Range... I am really delighted for this purchase..... Clear and Sharp picture quality and amazing sound experience... still face no connectivity issue. Even engineer visit was also on time for installation and demo.  overall value for money
1814,4,Wonderful,Until now no issues. But the service engineer didnt do the proper demonstration. He said we do not have enough time to explain everything like that.
1815,5,Classy product,"Excellent TV  Best Pros of the TV is 4k Video playback, (Youtube supports upto 1080p only). Built in Chromecast etc  Best in the budget range.  A minor con might be the sound department which is just flat. Also the display is not up to the mark but what do you expect from HD panel in this budget.  Just go for this TV its awesome"
1816,5,Highly recommended,it is very good tv in this range and I loved it. I would also thanks to Flipkart for fast delivery.
1817,4,VFM - Primarily designed to move away from Cable,"The product good.  Delivery / Installation - Delivery was perfect. Installation was a BIG PROBLEM. I had to follow up for 2-3 weeks to get it installed. Apparently they were out of wall mount bracket. Finally I brought my own bracket. But be prepared to do a lot of follow up with no concrete answers from Flipkart. However once the person who came to do the installation was knowledgeable and presentable.  Picture Quality - Overall picture quality is good. But could be better in terms of brightness.  Connectivity - Can connect anything and stream using WiFi, USB or HDMI. Plenty of ports available.  Remote - Very sleek remote. But difficult to type up searches. Its easy to speak and search, which is kinda cool.  Overall TV is much better than expected and for the price its offered. The question still remains as to what is the durability. By the way this TV is designed to move away from Cable / Dish provider. It shows Hotstar, YouTube and such apps up front if default is not selected."
1818,5,Great product,wow very nice Mi LED Smart TV Pro
1819,4,Delightful,it is good in time delivery and installation and demo good service.it is worthy of having TV. only thing is that product may be supply with suggestable stabilizers.i am confused which stabilizer how much rating can be used for MI 43' LED TV
1820,5,Excellent,wowww superb TV superb quality value for money I loved it fast delivery & one time installation done thanks Flipkart
1821,3,Nice,I checkup USB & HDMI port is best nice TV and connectivity is good picture quality is very good Avi video is not supported
1822,4,Delightful,Mi tv is awesome in this price range..picture and sound quality is excellent. Needs strong wifi to connect to internet. Screen mirroring is possible only with chromecast. A smartphone itself cant be connected to the tv for screen mirroring but it need another source of wifi connection. Overall its a nice product..
1823,5,Excellent,"📺: Best android tv in this range 🌟 🖼️ Picture: quality is good and visibility from different angles are well 🔉 Sound: there is no issue till 80% volume which is more than enough for normal size room but sound starts to become unclear/ distorted when volume is more than 80% 🔊 🔌 Connectivity: 3️⃣ hbmi, 2️⃣ ubs type A, 1️⃣ ethernet, 1️⃣ A/V connector & 1️⃣ for antenna are enough for regular usage 🎛️ Remote: is small, lightweight and minimal which is perfect for overall use. Only issue is OK-GOOGLE button is always laggy irrespective of internet connection which will may take sometime to get used to 💠 Software: Patch wall is smooth but sometimes Google home is a bit laggy which is probably because of 1 gb ram. 💪 Performance: Depending on the internet speed 4️⃣k video even 8️⃣k video works smoothly without any lagg while playing. Connected with 2TB harddrive and TV loads data from it without any lagg which is quite good. Default media player doesn't support some of the file format which can be played using VLC media player available is google play store. 🚚 Delivery: Flipkart delivery is on time 🏅 🚧 Installation: Free installation and first demo is useful if someone is not tech savvy 😁 💸: Definitely value for money ✳️: Improvement: Hope to see ram improvement on future model of this tv."
1824,4,Nice product,"Good deal in this price range. Display is not that good but sound,patchwall,Android everything works fine. Doesn't have web browser. We need to download from play store. Most of the apps are not available in play store."
1825,5,Super!,Awesome picture quality and easy to understand smart android tv. I like it too much
1826,4,Value-for-money,price wise good choice as now MI is assumed brand . but build quality not so good and even picture quality. otherwise good product to buy. on lesser amount you can buy samsung panel from karol bagh.
1827,5,Worth every penny,Super mi led tv 4A Pro but flipkart delivery very super fast thank you so much and installation is very long time
1828,5,Out of words to describe this beautiful TV.,"Finally got the TV installed today. A gentleman named Soumen from jeeves installed the TV and he was a very good person. I was quite skeptical about buying this TV as i have used sony bravia before and have experienced very good picture and sound quality. But today after switching the TV on, I was like WOW! The picture quality is beyond my expectation.Even the sound quality on the 20 watts speakers are just awesome!! Mind it, I have used bravia before.I am listing some PROS and CONS below.  PROS *Installation service was awesome. Mr.Soumen was a nice person and he explained everything even though he was quite late for his home. *Picture quality. It's just jaw dropping gorgeous. *No issues with wifi connectivity. I used Jio with hotspot in mobile. *Sound quality is also commendable. The speakers are damn loud.  CONS *NONE!  TIP: Those having picture quality issue, turn off adaptive brightness in settings. You will really feel a huge difference. Else, it's still very good.  Overall it is total value for money."
1829,5,Classy product,Mi led smart TV 4A pro (32) nice and very protect is speaker quality & remote is good accept is nice shine

1834,3,Fair,Good.. Worth for the money.. If mount is free with this.. That's would be awesome deal... But it's OK
1835,5,Simply awesome,Awesome TV to buy I am writing some pros and cons of this TV Pros :  1. The sound quality of this is awesome. 2. This TV comes with inbuilt chromecast with which you can cast your laptop and mobile very easily. 3. Use jio fi without jio sim you can still cast your device easily without much lagging if you doesn't have active internet connection. 4. This TV comes with Android OS which have pre installed Google play store. 5 . the TV remote is Bluetooth instead of infrared so you don't need to point the remote towards the TV to use.  Cons : 1. This TV doesn't comes with pre installed Netflix nor you can download through play store. 2. TV is hd ready not full hd but at this price you can't expect more. 3. For wall mounting you need to pay extra 399. 4. WiFi connectivity is little bit slow.  Conclusion : 1. For small rooms and home this TV is best. 2. Don't forget to get the extended warranty for this TV.
1836,4,Wonderful,I am 2 weeks into using this set and I must say it is a splendid budget product. This kind of picture quality at this price is something truly great to see from Mi. I would recommend a buy without any hiccups or second thought.
1837,4,Good choice,it's worth 13K. but we have to see how it works on a longer run. it's just been a week. and I have 3 years warranty. I think it's good for now.

The connectivity options of the tv is very useful. I can sign in my google account and surf youtube and other web series app. Besides it has patchwall. It has google chromecast inbuilt. Awesome.  It has bluetooth remote controller. No matter which direction you point the remote, it works. Additionally I can connect bluetooth speaker with this TV.  The display panel is very crisp & clear. It has 60hz refresh rate. The channels are very clear.  It's a steal deal at this price. Go get it."

1849,5,Great product,Overall the tv is great except the connectivity. Screen cast function is not too good and lags sometimes. Connecting the tv by Google home app is also not very convenient as the connectivity is not so good. Maybe xiaomi can work on this problem. Otherwise the tv is great.
1850,5,Must buy!,"After lots of research, confusion I finally ordered Mi and to be honest I am quite amazed by the performance of the TV. Delivery and installation was super duper fast(within 30hrs delivery, installation done). Picture quality is quite good, sound is amazing, smooth connectivity too."

Sound quality is excellent and requirement of external sound not felt. TV is superesponsive on good WiFi networks. Packing - delivery - Installation 5+ stars since delivery and installation done on same day. Google sound recognition system is working flawlessly. Remote is little delicate , I am using mobile remote. Overall Deal of Feel good ! Thanks !"

1858,5,Super!,fantastic TV quality is best in all and value for money as well and fast service by flipkart
1859,4,Nice product,"picture quality 1920x1080 superb 10/10  connectivity : pendrive and HDD are easily accessible. Casting fails sometimes as TV is not available in the list of available devices and needs restart. Voice control takes a few seconds to start recording, the delay is quite long sometimes and irritating.  Sound : Sound is very loud. Even with a bit of volume, it is pretty audible in a big room. But the lows are very bad. Unable to hear low voices if the volume is low. Keeping it loud makes the highs too loud.  These are the only issues I found. But at a price of 23000, android TV is worth. I would still recommend anyone to go for it. Buying a sound bar would be better."
1860,5,Simply awesome,Great value for money.. At a price of a Mobile phone u r getting a Smart Led 43'
1861,5,Terrific,"I got MI TV pervious week ,its working good and nice picture ,Sound quality .This TV is worth of Cost ."

1866,4,Very Good,Very nice picture quality. Sound is pretty good but I have to increase or decrease the volume at some time continuously as a pictures are running by But Overall as for a price comparison it is worth it with a voice remote and a android features built in it.

1874,4,Good choice,awesome product from mi.....unbelivable price for such a configuration...we can say one of the best tv under such a great price.......just awesome .........mind blowing......fantastic sound ...fabulois picture quality but some it hangs on periods of connectivity with ur dth

1876,5,Excellent,good looking and bright display. u need two smartphones or a modem and a smartphone to cast your mobile. value for the price .. nice product.
1877,5,Best in the market!,"Delivery and installation was exactly as committed. Installation person did offer additional warranty while paying for wall mount bracket. The product is value for money with connectivity and picture quality. Picture quality has to be adjusted, switch off dynamic background light and it will be better. Sound is OK ok types. Mi Infra cable does not work with SD set top box (connected via AV port). Patchall is a gimmick so better to stick with Android TV home and download apps as you wish. Good as your bedroom or spare TV or if your tight on budget."
1878,5,Brilliant,bahut hi acha product jitna bhi taarif kare kam hai nice sound nice picture qualti value for money lovely product picture quality vivild par rakhe sound movies par at best sound and best picture but conectivity is very bad

1880,4,Worth the money,Nice LED smart TV at this price range. Compared with any other top brand...
1881,5,Classy product,Prompt Delivery & Installation by Flipkart team. TV is awesome in low budget. Recommend to all who needs good quality in low price.
1882,5,Great product,So awesome TV it is. And sound and pictures quality is to good and features is like android phone .the cost of the TV is to goood
1883,5,Just wow!,Superb smart tv i think best smart tv at this price
1884,5,Awesome,"awesome picture quality even if we compare it sony bravia hd ready,this picture quality will give a tough competition to sony. speakers are nice but if u r music lover then a little disappointing. connectivity ports are enough for any online or offline purpose. 1 gb ram and 5 gb available storage with quad core processor really provide it smooth function but don't compare it's processor with snapdragon of smartphons. overall I give this 5/5 in this price. I got it in 12k during offer."
1885,5,Terrific purchase,I buy Mi LED Tv at 11999/- from flipkart flash sale. finaly this TV is Installed Yesterday . Sound Qauility And Chromecast Feature is awesom.Bluetooth connectivity of remote is very great its works from 15 meters.Nice Product .Thanks Mi and Flipkart.

1888,5,Mind-blowing purchase,Best led tv of mi led pro 43 inch. It is really good mi led tv.
1889,5,Great product,Overall this is the best tv at price segment sound quality is just awesome picture quality also good but after using 1 day one usb port stop working. 😢😢
1890,4,Delightful,Awesomeness fabulous Very Nice product Thanks Flipkart Very Nice 👍 Must Buy it
1891,5,Brilliant,Picture quality is Very Good. Mi Patch wall is good feature. Mirror cast connectivity is littel probleme. But overall very good in this price. I love Mi Go for it.... And enjoy.....
1892,4,Good quality product,Best in this price segment.. My personal view after usage of 10 days.. picture quality - Pretty decent Sound quality - Best in class.. Only one disadvantage is sometimes the network gets disconnected. May be it can be fixed through a system update... Rest all good..
1893,4,Value-for-money,The product is worthy buying. U will enjoy it is vlaue for money. It has Bluetooth too. Sound is also good
1894,5,Highly recommended,"Really an awesome product. Everything is so nice complete package in this price. Thanks to Flipkart for delivery in time and also installation is done on next only. Picture Quality, Sound Quality, Connectivity everything is so nice. I am completely satisfied.  The only bad part is that the person coming for demo have no knowledge about the TV: 1. He said you can transfer image from pen drive to TV memory. But later when I said please transfer data from my pen drive to gallery. He failed to do so. Fact- Actually the internal memory is for the apps which you download from play store.  2. He said external speakers will not get connected because it is using blah blah things. Fact-External Speakers can be connected so simple there is port available in TV.  3.He didn't know about Google cast. He said ask customer care, I can't to do anything. Fact-It is very easy to connect by using Google home app. Simply go in profile of the app chose the option mirroring and it will work.  Other than the defective demo 😁person the TV justifies all the quality to be called as best seller. In this price range it is beyond the expectations. Myself and my family is very happy."
1895,5,Highly recommended,This TV is definitely worth the price. Internet connectivity is smooth and handy. I have been watching enjoying NETFLIX and Prime past 1 month and it goes without a glitch. If you are willing to go for a smart TV but don't wish to spend extravagant money then this TV should definitely be your first choice. Kindly don't consider all negative reviewers for this product as they are nothing but spammers.
1896,5,Just wow!,best quality product in best price!! value of money too! I'll bit connectivity problem sometime. but overall it's a too good product by xiaomi. ∆ again best delivery on time and perfect scheduled install!!  thanks Flipkart. regards from T.j's🤘
1897,5,Great product,Good product in price range but side finishing of tv is not so good but overall it is worth for money
1898,5,Simply awesome,Very Good Smart TV At very affordable price. With out second thought any one can go for it.
1899,5,Simply awesome,very good build quality very good sound and picture quality is very good I love it very very much installation engineer doesn't come after 10 days password
1900,4,Delightful,"After 10 days I can say to MI 43 android tv is most of buy in market and I explain this with android OS is really good function like as a contrast and visualisation like many more beneficial functions. Sound, WiFi connectivity is good, I recommended buy this tv."
1901,4,Value-for-money,"Very nice product from MI, Fully satisfy with the product. Picture quality is nice, 4k is also supported. Volume is load enough to fill medium size room. Soundbar will be added benefit. I side loaded few application which are not available directly one the play store."
1902,5,Great product,Value for money and user-friendly latest Android TV. Delivery and installation was prompt and pleasant. I would recommend it to my friend's to not have second thoughts about buying.
1903,2,Could be way better,"should have more friendly to android apps and wallmount stand is pathetic, it is very and hurt hands while putting pen drive or something... should have handled the sharp edges properly. should have proper volume control when watching movies sometime goes up and down and even not able to hear audio properly.. only cost is less but not comfortable with features"
1904,5,Perfect product!,"Simply superb ..... Fantastic TV thanks flipkart best service as usual. Not only online shoping,. but a trust for the best"
1905,5,Just wow!,delivery was on the time and one day earlier installation by the Jeeves service engineer. He did nice work. Product is excellent. Nice experience of Android TV . Best experience of entertainment! Hoping for long last Best performance of this Smart TV!
1906,5,Brilliant,LED is too good. but it's on off lite is not functioning properly. I didn't get my LED on or off when I'm on my LED..so kindly check it
1907,4,Good quality product,"I m using this tv last 10 days.. buy in 20500 rupees. Picture quality of this TV is not good.. I m using alternate Samsung smart tv, and the quality of my Samsung TV is ultra HD.. sound quality is good.. Google Chromecast inbuilt is a bonus point for this tv Very light weight. Bluetooth remote is also good with voice assistance Build quality bad.. but not good as samsung Sound output good via additional speaker But overall it's a good product according to price * connectivity and cast from mobile is very bad problem in casting"
1908,5,Terrific purchase,"Picture quality is good, based on your connection. If you will use regular quality of TV channels then it will be bursted the quality cause it is 108cm so you better use HD channel to experience a better quality of pictures. Sound is too good. I wasn't expected tht much good quality from 20W speakers but its kinda good and loud. In the connectivity class it is not that good, I am telling this based on its Bluetooth connectivity. Sometimes it is hard to connect with Bluetooth. And 1 major thing everyone should have known, I just realized that whenever i start my tv it always shows the default set date and time not the exact date and time whether I have already setted up date and time as current are before switch off the tv. Overall it is good. and value for money of this segment's smart/android TV."
1909,4,Very Good,I have used MI 4A before buying 4A pro.. Comparatively 4A is better than 4A pro by considering display and sound.. Coming to features 4A pro is more and more advanced than 4A..we have more options to optimise display settings like eye comforts and etc..main drawback in 4A pro is display brightness issues.. By Overall my best suggestion go with 4A. Thanq RAVI
1910,4,Good quality product,product is fantastic. good connectivity with good sound... To be like a theater experience...need to connect home theater. It has Bluetooth.... that's why I purchased it....otherwise I was thinking to purchase vu or Thomson tv.
1911,5,Excellent,"Very Good Tv Within this Price Range.Sound Quality is awesome.I would suggest this TV to everyone who has desire for smart tv but price is a constraint,must go for this tv.Delivery Of Flipkart as usual well on time and also installation happened on the same day.Thanks MI and Flipkart."
1912,4,Worth the money,"a product worth every penny, best part is that u can stream/play 4k videos on YouTube etc at 60 fps . What more do u want ,sound is excellent. It has a technology similar to HDR. Best image quality."
1913,4,Good quality product,"It's over all a very good TV at this price point.My review was decided in to pros and cons, if cons is not a matter then I will recommend this TV...  PROS 1. Android TV 2.Good sound quality 3.Best price at 23k 4.IPS Panel  Cons 1.no Wall Mount will provide , we need to buy with extra amount 500/- 2.Brighteness s was low when compared to other 43 inch TV's"
1914,4,Good choice,"It's a good and worth product to be bought. light in weight, clarity in pic and clears to operate."
1915,5,Perfect product!,"after 10days of satisfied use, I can say its an awesome product. Even the person who came for installation (use to work for Sony tv installation as well) said on the very first comment, its no where less than a Sony tv picture quality wise. I also feel the same after using for last 10 days. installation was awesome in my case on the day of delivery itself with clear and friendly demo. Thanx MI"
1916,5,Terrific,good at this price rang .  same as like vu TVs  display clarity just gud enough .(above avg )
1917,5,Brilliant,"Overall great deals. No brightness issues noticed those were mentioned in some feedbacks. Good picture quality n all smart tv features available. Pro version is great experience with Google voice search feature. However, voice search option appears 4 seconds late after pressing button on remote. Not sure how remove this delay. Thanks"
1918,4,Good choice,Delivered on time and installation was also done on the same day hats off to Flipkart and Jeeves. Overall value for money....just go ahead and buy. 4k videos looks awesome. Just follow Tech singh videos on YouTube for sideloading the Apps which are not available in playstore. Please don't compare the product with Sony and Samsung....they are top brands. if you see the features against the price then you will understand the difference. I love the magic remote the most.
1919,3,Good,Excellent Quality & Sound. Worthy Product for the money I spent. Very Much happy with the installation & Demo and the quality Picture.  After two months TV started to show lines at the top and bottom across the screen. Call logged and Service Engineer is yet to come. I have expected atleast TV will work for atleast 2 years without any issues but within 2 months it started to degrade.
1920,5,Best in the market!,"Value for money!.! Got it delivered on time. Good packaging n demo team was also on time. Picture quality n sound quality is too impressive. They should work on some software bugs like issue wit Bluetooth connection, LED status light for indication of TV on/off condition. Finally, happy with the buy. Will update if any other issue s are shown up."
1921,4,Value-for-money,"good product and nice picture quality ,I am happy to buy it, this is nice product to this price range.."
1922,5,Super!,Mi TV has exceeded my expectations. Highly satisfied and display quality of the TV is excellent. Android TV interface with play store is an also an excellent feature. Overall value for money item.
1923,5,Awesome,"Fantastic option if you are planning to buy a smart TV on budget. Using since last one week, no complaints whatsoever. Use some preloaded apks like aptoid tv to install prime videos, Netflix, moviesHD etc. All apps work like a charm (some may need an USB mouse to function fully). Picture quality mind-blowing for the price."
1924,4,Nice product,only issue for me is picture in moving scenes whether cricket / action movies or for that matter anything which is shown moving fast is not clearly visible but gives blurring / kind of multiple or mirror images ... rest all is good ... but again I haven't checked other brands / high end models whether this kind of effect u get in all these kind of LED TVs ... otherwise ok to good wrt sound and other features with budget ...
1925,5,Fabulous!,I got the tv in 40 hrs installed in 8 hrs just woow The tv is good but with low bass sound good enough Switch of dnr option in settings for better display
1926,5,Brilliant,"awesome product, in this price range you can not find anything better, best tv by one of the best thrusting brand MI.. sound could be better overall best.. no brightness issue found .."
1927,5,Simply awesome,"product is awesome. picture quality is good, sound quality is very good only one suggestion that TV does not support FTP it only support MTP through USB"
1928,5,Excellent,Worth the money for buying smart Tv for this price range. The HD quality and sound is awesome. 3 USB and 3 HDMI ports are plus for this TV and it's a new release of the year. Only cons i feel is the non availability auto source selection feature(PS:After March update this feature is now available) and for people who used usual remotes this would be new. The mute button isn't available and more of the actions can be done using voice command. On the whole a perfect purchase.
1929,5,Just wow!,TV works awesome and the features are also wonderful at this price. Using it since last 20 days and found no issues till date. Its a good bet at this price.
1930,5,Highly recommended,picture quality sound is simple super.. it's like peer brands t. v... Happy to purchase ... flipkart service is very great.. timely delivery and installation... nice..
1931,5,Wonderful,After using a couple of days i am writing about the new mi led 4a pro... 1st its fully value of money.. U won't get this much of big screen within this range and when comes to the picture quality its really awesome and the sound is too good... If u one bass then u can add one sound bar but although its good and the connectivity is also good from mobile... Mi is really giving a good product with this price and i love it
1932,5,Brilliant,"Great value for money. Picture quality is good enough and 1080p works very fine. Sound quality and loudness is great as per led tv's. And i read some reviews regarding connectivity errors, as till now i didn't face any of such issues and its obvio for hd quality videos it will require good connection and high speed. Everything is just great. Go for it."
1933,5,Terrific purchase,The tv is awsome in this range.. I have purchased it 5 days ago... The installation person was well behaved and good also.. Thanks MI...
1934,4,Nice product,Very nice for the price. Works great. This is my first LED and was facing some brightness issue. This can be fixed by changing the picture setting mode manual by removing dynamic off.
1935,4,Pretty good,It’s a nice tv with good picture quality however there are some issues like voice search will not work if connect air mouse and second when you connect mi Mr cable whenever you power on the tv it gives pop up everytime
1936,5,Classy product,awesome product with valuable product i am really satisfied really happy good picture quality but sound is not high in TV connectivity is also good and voice command also good
1937,4,Delightful,"Best product with in the given price range, Even better than the some overpriced products in terms of functions, looks as well as connectivity. It is the best product if u want to go for budgeted, reliable and well functioned product. An extended warranty of 2 year may be purchased from flipkart gives u addon satisfaction as ur product got under warranty for 3 years(1 year by Company & 2 years by flipkart) & best is u will get all this under Rs.25000 (as I purchased during Republic week Sale)."

1940,5,Fabulous!,Value for for money ... thank u MI Flipkart delivery and installation incredible... thank u flipkart for giving delivery before time with installation.flipkart 5* for you quick response even faster than offline shop purchase.... thank u so much
1941,4,Worth the money,really it's nice and value of money HD quality is superb google connectivity net suffering all marvelous but little bit picture quality is a area of improvement by MI .but overall good tv I extend my 2 years warranty also by paying 1930 to Jeeves engineer . so everyone go for it you will definitely like that.
1942,5,Super!,"whenever I switch from Android or patchwall to HDMI input to watch set top box live tv , some times picture is not available but sound of channel is there. after switching off and restarting then set top box connected and picture and sound started to display. installation is not up to the mark , they don't have proper wallmount for 43 inch TV. they have installed local wall mount suitable for 18 to 32 inch . I have seen cover of wall mount after their visit and TV is not straight on the wall slightly sliding from one side . Jeeves given me name of one person and for installation 2 another guys coming to install and not on time . time slot given me 12 to 1 PM and installation done on 4.30 pm . I m not satisfied by installation they don't have proper mi wall mount and not given bill of wall mount."
1943,5,Great product,"This is a review after a using for 1 month.  Just ask two questions before buying it.  Q. Why should one buy it? A. First of all, easy on pocket. You get one of the best TV for half of the price of Sony Samsung and other competitors. * Display is good enough for SD set top box (but HD is recommended). * Built quality is very good, similar to it's competitors. * Sound is loud and clear, but if you need home theater quality you will have to connect an external Bluetooth sound system. * WiFi connectivity is super fast and gets connected with ease. * Patchwall works fine. just need a account to watch all content. * Overall the experience is amazing. Very happy to have this TV.  Q. Why shouldn't one but it. A. I don't see any reason for not buying it.  SO JUST GO FOR IT..."
1944,5,Terrific,Very good television. If you are facing problem with brightness turn off backlight from settings. Display- 9/10. (IPS display is amazing). Sound- 9/10. Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Connectivity- 10/10. Design- 8/10. ( no problem if you wall mount it.). Ports- 10/10. (All ports are easily accessible even if TV is wall mounted.) Chromecast- 10/10. Set top box channels: SD channels quality - 10/10 (it is much better than that on Samsung LED TV). HD channels quality - 9/10. Value for money - 10/10. Total Rating - 9.5/10. You won't be disappointed for sure. Buy it.
1945,5,Must buy!,"I was so confused about ordering this product regarding picture quality and brightness but after installation and 3 days use i had an awesome experience.if we off dynamic quality it works really amazing,patchwall is quite Impressive , thanks Flipkart and mi for wonderful TV"
1946,5,Highly recommended,MI LED 4A PRO SMART TV is really a good TV in this price range. sound quality is awesome.no lag in scring mirroring.support full hd video very good. 4k video also support very good. interface also very attractive. go for it without any 2nd thinking . delivery and installation process also good by Flipkart.
1947,5,A wonderful product!!!,Really a wonderful product. Worth for the money. Sound and picture are very clear and lot of new features. Able to use online JIOTV also for watching TV channels. So good. Supports most of the android apps from google store.
1948,3,Nice,good product this budget and then performances excellent color is slidely low but it ok sound is exordinary connectivity is good  conclusion I will need more app support in future  I m a biggest collector of xiaomi product 🤗
1949,5,Classy product,Realy feeling so happy on this tv..In India there are so many peoples are being below middle class...(78%)...their Good quality LED tv dream is now made as truth ..Thank u MI👍
1950,5,Wonderful,"i really appreciate Mi to give this excellent product.1.picture quality is amazing. 2.100% sure there is no brightness issue.really good product. 3.connectivity is very simple and too fast. 4.best android tv in this price,go for it definitely you get satisfied."
1951,4,Really Nice,"On the receipt of the product , had a doubt whether it is a smart TV as the product description was not carrying the word Smart TV. It is an Android based smart TV. Model No L43M5-AB  I had actually purchased this smart TV based on a recent review stating that the issue of no option of HDMI auto-play can be overcome by enabling input settings to - Stay on the previous source. But I could not find any such settings option for this particular model. Mi support team also later confirmed that HDMI auto play option is not available for this model. The installation technician has conveyed that this option was available for the previous model, but not for this. Really need to explore further for any possible settings option .  The need to select the source each time you switch on the smart TV is an inconvenience as mostly we will be using the TV to watch DTH channels. It is really difficult for elderly people to choose the source through the remote control.  The smart TV is otherwise good and is a value for money product. No issue on the picture quality or sound or connectivity. Have set up the Mi IR Cable for controlling the DTH set top box as well ."
1952,3,Decent product,"TV is great. As some one mentioned we can stick to same source in inputs it is wrong(Please think and and write your review so that it will not affect some one who is buying ). As if now that option is not available . Always you should go for selecting source with TV remote, it will be problem for old parents if you are buying for them. Screen mirroring is not working for me with my Samsung mobile. over all I am using it with tatasky hd setup box. it is doing great in terms of picture quality and sound. same day delivery and installation great work flipkart and Jeeves."
1953,4,Delightful,after 10 days of use 1.value for money 2. sound quality is best for YouTube and other net contents. not for set top box. 3. chrome cast connectedi good for redmi mobile and not connected properly with other mobiles. 4. video quality is poor for sd set top box. but good for YouTube.
1954,5,Classy product,very very great smart TV great function everything is ok and installation service is so great I salute you yours service thanks seller and flipkart.
1955,5,Just wow!,"1. Flipkart goods fast delivery 2. Good installation and demo 3. MI led good performance, nice picture and sound , 4. Only sound reduce dth connectivity otherwise super, Thanks Flipkart"
1956,5,Classy product,Tv is amazing I love Mi 4A pro. Flipkart delivered on expected date of delivery. And to my surprise on the same day installation is also done. But the installation boy needs some more experience. Tv is working superb now. My family is happy with Tv. HD channels are awesome.... Hope works same for many years. Write my review after a month. Go for it my thumbs up for it such amazing budget TV.
1957,5,Awesome,"Jeeves delayed installation. product delivered on 23 Jan 2019 and installed 28 Jan 2019.service engineer behavior is good. Tv picture quality is good and as well as sound and conectivety also good. It's not having any brightness issue. If you compare this TV Sony Samsung or LG brand then we will be upset but if see price difference where Sony, Samsung, LG cost more than 2.5 times approx same configuration. So it's a very good deal if u have ample money you can purchase Sony, Samsung, LG otherwise this TV is best deal."
1958,3,Not a full smart tv,Pros: - Good Video & Audio Quality. - Remote works great for the TV.  Cons: - Netflix & PrimeVideo is not available to download in this TV. - Very small list of supported Apps.  Overall: I would have given 5 star if Netflix & PrimeVideo would have been available on this TV.
1959,4,Nice product,Best T V . Thank you flipkart and mi.Some friends wrote it it has brightness problem but there's no such issue.I got best picture even in brightness @50.l recommend this for everyone.android apps are working well but there's some issues in chrome cast.
1960,5,Simply awesome,"Totaly value of money, Nice sound and nice picture quality with nice brightness not any brightness issue, Only one thing i m not understand how to connect the miracast through mobile. Thanks to flipkart and Jeevas for timely delivery and instalation."
1961,5,Classy product,Fully satisfied with smart tv with smart price. Fast n speedy delivery. Installation done on same day. Impress with Jeeves person for installation & full demo.
1962,3,Good,"Playstore must needed more TV compatible apps. even wikipedia like applications are not there. Bluetooth pairing with speaker issue need to be corrected. remote should be more descriptive, at present feel irritating. chrome casting result using YouTube app is fine but while using other apps crash consistently and visual output not running continuously. no option to read documents like PDF, word etc."
1963,5,Super!,"best performance , i am not compare to other products but in my point of view 'mi 4A with android LED tv' is awesome performance and smart work as per specifications like youtube, wifi connection, USB connection, etc. ~ bluetooth remote is also excellent ~ picture quality is superb and I really happy because my setup box is simple but without HD setup box I watch programme in high resolution. ~ sound system is very high and lovely hearing ~ easy system like smart mobile operating  and last but very true ""delivery, installation and demo service"" of flipcart is carying and fast 👍  thanks team."
1964,5,Awesome,worth the buy .... much better much improved than 4A .... Android TV at 24000 is awesome
1965,4,Worth the money,"Superb product.. Connectivity is excellent, value for money, Sound clarity is nice and picture clarity is superb... Thank u mi..."
1966,4,Picture settings not getting applied to HDMI / AV input,"I recently purchased Mi LED Smart TV 4A Pro. The product is really good. I have observed that picture settings are applied only to the online applications like YouTube only, whereas the changes done in the picture settings like brightness, contrast, color, hue etc. are not applied to HDMI / AV input signals. Manufacturers of the product must apply a software patch to solve this issue."
1967,5,Wonderful,Very very good service by flipkart as well as ekart and Jeeves Installation and demo was amazing. But mi tv is outstanding from all aspects. It is so nice.
1968,5,Terrific purchase,The show stopper product in sale! This makes you happier in every case cause the best-selling brand gives the best price!! So don't be hesitation on this purchase asap.. Just one major update need is netflix will not work directly!
1969,4,Delightful,"5 star for on time delivery and installation, got it within 24 hours of ordering and installed. Great service from Flipkart.  Coming to TV. Picture quality is good, but should improve on sound quality. Connectivity to network is easy and quick but connecting mobile Android remote through Bluetooth is not proper. The so called hours of free content is not all free, actually it includes free contents from applications like hangama, erosnow, zee5 and sunnxt content is not available as we need a paid account for that.  Applications available in play store include only hotstar, YouTube, zee5 and prime, Netflix is not available. The plus point is, we can side load applications ☺️, so no problem.  Overall a product I recommend."
1970,5,"""Wise deal for the price""","Got this delivered in 3 days. Installation and product demo by Jeeves was done on the day of delivery.  This product is the best deal you can buy at this price point considering the high price of android tv offerings from other major brands currently in the market. Also purchased the 2 year extended warranty by Flipkart.  Talking about picture quality, some tweaks in the settings are needed to extract the best out of the display. Picture settings-Custom (Brightness-45-48,Contrast-60,Saturation-65,Sharpness-50,Hue-50) Backlight-50 (Will enhance the LED life span) Dynamic Brightness-Off DNR-High HDMI Colour-Auto  Talking about connectivity,addition of bluetooth and chromecast is a major upgrade from the last series. Connections are butter smooth with negligible latency. Haven't encountered any kind of disconnection issues yet.  The sound from the unit is above average wherein you have preset and custom options to suit your preferences.  UI is smooth. Additions of more apps in android TV playstore will be a plus point.  Build of the main unit is all plastic. The buttons of the remote provides a tactile feedback which could have been made softer as you find in other remotes.  Voice search through smart remote over regular typing option is a joy to use. Also can use Android TV remote in your android device to control operations."
1971,5,Super!,This review on day 1 usage. Pros: 1. Excellent sound 2. Real colors 3. Usb usage nice. 4. Google assistance working awesome 5. No brightness issue. 6. YouTube playing 1080 videos without lag with mobile Hotspot. 7. Easy operations 8. Good design 9. Worth buying. 10. Excellent quality and clarity of cable channels. So imagine about HD channels. I have to try HD oncen Detailed review I will write after more usage. And update you if I found some problem with TV. Cons: remote is small. But handy.

1973,4,Value-for-money,"TV is good, only drawback that i saw is that when we reboot the device, it opens in android homepage and its annoying switching source every time.. That's an nit picking though as its there in their old Mi TVs.. wish they give it in their next update sooner.."

1991,2,Bad quality,Good 1) picture quality 2) features 3) installation 4) sound quality  Bad 1) connectivity 2) miracast doesn't work(1 out of 1000 tries it may cast mobile)  HORRIBLE flipkart discloses my personal information and I get sms call that I won lottery. reported as a fraud with flipkart NO reply from Fljpkart. additionally I have seen one more comment whos information was leaked by flipkart and he got same fraud sms and call.

2012,4,Careful to opt exchange,"Hello, Please be careful those who opt for Exchange Old TV. I had very bad experience with Flipkart. I Purchased MI Smart TV (43 Inch) with Exchange offer. My present Samsung 29 Inch CRT TV was working fine there was not any issue at all but it was rejected by examiner by saying there is problem in picture tube and immediately reject the offer and i have to pay additionally Rs 1400. When i asked about problem he was rude and not able to justify properly. So please be careful while opt for Exchange.  Now about the product. It is really nice product with all smart TV features. Easy to operate, sound and picture quality are nice."
2013,5,Awesome,"The TV is awesome,, Connectivity little bit poor means Everytime we must select input i.e HDMI input , This one is irritating every time other things fine,, Nice TV with this price range,, Thanks Flipkart"
2014,5,"Fabulous product with lot of features, yet within the budget","Initially confused between features of A) Mi LED Smart TV 4A 108 cm and B) Mi LED Smart TV 4A ""Pro"" 108 cm mentioned in the highlights of both the products and ordered a wrong product A, as one of the features of patchwall is mentioned in ""product description"" instead of ""highlights"" while checking the product in Flipkart page. Thanks to Flipkart & MI customer care, as they told when I called later, that the 4A Pro is the advanced version, which made me to cancel and order the right product. I took extra 2 yrears warranty also along with the product.  Product got delivered and installation & demo also completed on time with flexible timing. Installation engineer will carry wall mount (fixed & flexible) also along with them, so that we can select the one suitable and pay for it. Fixed wall mount I ordered but cancelled later, as flexible wall mount is suitable and bought from the installation engineer.  Excellent Smart TV with in the Budget with many features like in built Chromecast, Wifi, USB connectivity, Mobile mirroring, patchwall, Google voice search, Powered by android and many more. Overall a very good experience with the product as I already started using."

2018,5,Brilliant,"Value for money. In built Bluetooth, voice search, smart remote etc are in the best comparing the segment. Better than Haier, lloyd, mitashi, onida and sanyo 43 inch tvs. Mi is always the best. Screen quality is best for Made in India mi tvs"

2030,5,Fabulous!,"Users please update Android System of TV through internet wi-fi. Many bugs have been removed in the update. Also option comes when TV comes directly (Autoplay) on HDMI input when put on. This option is very useful for senior citizens and parents. But for this, Android System have to be updated in ""About"" section of Menu."
2031,5,Just wow!,"Excellent LED Smart TV and Quality with reasonable price. Must go with it. It has all the necessary equipment that we want in any Smart TV.  Remote is not available in any store, but online only worth Rs.1500 price. So handle remote with care. Technician also offers stabilizer worth Rs.1650 the must require for any fluctuation. I also extended the warranty with 2 Years worth Rs.1930.  So you will get this MI Smart TV in 22999(MI LED TV) + 499(TV Wall Mount) + 1650 (TV Stabilizer) + 1930 (2 Years Extended Warrenty) = 27,078 with all above equipment including GST"

Dolby sound is excellent, you feel cinematic sound experience, connectivity is good but one thing Chromecast need fastest net connection otherwise 4k vdo will be turn into 360p / 480p. voice command mode is also very accurate and catch exact word as we spoke. SD channels runs very good, Also delivery & installation were done on expected time, so thanks flipkart for this awesome led TV."
2040,4,MI means TRUST from now on...,"MI LED TV 4A PRO stays true to its Tag - ''Always believe something wonderful is about to happen'' I will clearly state all the pros & cons I've witnessed in my 20 days of usage, without any bias or unnecessary buttering. I'll describe my short history on why I chose MI... I was in a desperate need of a mobile last year when my old phone stopped working, & then after much research, I decided to buy MI REDMI 5A @ 4999/-. I was so impressed with its quality at such a reasonable rate, with absolutely no issues for whole 1 year, that when my old TV stopped working 20 days back, I closed my eyes & went for MI LED TV 4A PRO @ 21,999/-( all thanks to Flipkart Pay Day Offer), without window shopping OR watching YouTube reviews of guys likeTechnical Guruji, Geeky Ranjit etc.  What made me happy :- - Amazing Picture Quality. - Theatre-like Sound. - Stylish Design with a Rich look. - Simplest UI, even elders can understand. - Google Assistant & Simple Two-Step Wi-Fi Connectivity.  What Upset me :- - Pathetic Installation Guy from Jeeves, who spoke a lot of negative stuff about MI, just for getting his incentive, for trying to make me buy the additional warranty. - He was actually trying to lure me into buying the additional warranty saying '' MI is a China Ka Maal'', & it will stop working in some days & non-sense stuff like that.  My Genuine Advice : If you are looking for a budget TV under 25k, & you don't wish to compromise on Quality either, mark my words... MI LED TV 4A PRO will make you feel as if you've purchased a 50-60k range TV, with its breath-taking features, But, at the same time beware of Idiots from Jeeves who will try to spin your head by scaring you. Take them lightly as they are just interested in making you buy their extended warranty & other stuff they bring with them for their personal gains. Tell them NO... ""I TRUST MI'"

I have tested with all sources ( set top box, videos from pendrive, youtube, hotstar, zee5). The result was same , i requested for replacement. The mi Authoriesed technician has visited to check if the problem was real, he approved that complaint was real. Our replacement request was accepted. I felt glad that the problem would be solved with the new tv. They delivered the new tv, but the same problem exists . I think all mi tvs have the same problem of improper sync between audio and video. Today I got an update , i expected that the problem would be resolved with this update, but all my hopes went in vain. The problem still exists. I am no longer interested in again requesting for replacement or return. Because i know that it's a difficult process. And i know that all mi tvs have same problem. So every one please do check if there is same problem with your mi tv, please raise a complaint and mi company will resolve this issue with an ota update."

2244,1,Don't waste your money,"TV is superb. But FLIPKART is the worst place to order from. These people are totally irresponsible, as I received the on 6th April, and till 14th no installation was done. Everyday customer care calls are just horrible and everyday I had to explain my problem to them. But still they couldn't arrange for the installation at all. Never buy MI products from Flipkart. Best TV from a below par Flipkart."
2245,5,Awesome,good bill colety and good product...
2246,1,Useless product,"I got delivery of TV today. Installation Engineer arrived and tried to make settings. After so many efforts he remained unable to pair Remote Control with the TV, in between 2 set of new cells were also replaced.  Finally he requested to wait till evening when he comes with a new Remote Control. He arrived with new Remote and tied hard to set up but again Remote couldn't pair with TV.  He was making so many calls to customer care in return he was asked to send some videos of the problem showing no connection. After all this exercise remained continue till 7:00 pm and finally he declared that TV has some manufacturing problem.  Now TV is lying at my home waiting for reverse pick. I am amazed to see how defective/uninspected product can be dispatched to the customer. Come on Xiaomi it was not expected, it was my 1st ever purchase of MI brand product and unfortunately I will neither buy nor recommend Mi to anyone.  Above all Flipkart Response on whole issue is very irresponsible.  Never buy anything from Flipkart."
2247,1,Did not meet expectations,picture clarity is not the best
2248,5,Terrific purchase,Very good quality display
2249,4,Nice product,"Excellent product. Value for money. 4k HDR videos also play via usb & youtube. DTS Dolby atoms sound quality is awesome, not necessary external speakers. Bluetooth connection super. I have face the screen cast problem some times, but google home app solve this issues.

2318,3,Good,Not able to Connect Mobile via wireless... no mirroring options available
2319,1,Horrible,"This review is after 2 years of purchase. The horizontal lines have appeared on the screen inspite of utmost care. If the life of this product is 2-3 years at this cost, then this is the costliest product. Disappointed with the deteriorating performance just after 2 years."
2320,1,Horrible,"Bad products, lags alot, 1 gb ram is too low for even a 720p tv let alone a 1080p TV, also the 40 inch TV is not really 1080p, It comes with 720p preset, you can change it to 1080p with a few tweaks with your laptop/computer but it would invite many faults and glitches. I would suggest you not to do it, also if you can return it then do it asap and don't buy a tv with 1080p resolution/40 inch/ 43 inch regardless of any company, rather then that buy a HD ready/32 inch tv cause the performance will be the same in both or else look for a TV that comes with at least 2 gb ram."
2321,5,Awesome,Nice product
2322,1,Hated it!,"Chromecast built-in was DiSGusTing .. I bought this prodeuct for my online classes but i cant cast my screen, I tried with 5 phones of different brands including mi note 9 pro ! So, if u r buying this product for studies or for casting purpose then i suggest try oneplus or realme . I returned my product after 10 days and will try for other brand ."

2342,4,Worth the money,Nice product in this range
2343,3,Nice,TV is good but there is no screen mirroring option.
2344,1,Terrible product,"Wake up people, this is a 720P panel !! Period !! Output is being upscaled to 1080p..  This is my second try to educate people on the scam that Mi is doing selling cheap TVs in India, my first review was taken down by FK and Mi sighting pointless reasons..  Here is my another try, and hopefully won't go in vain (again)  it's been almost an year since I bought this TV, till date i regret everyday.. bcoz i was cheated in daylight by both FK and Mi on the specifications of the TV, no one has the technical expertise nor the proper knowledge to understand the real issue, which is quite unfortunate..  The panel is 720p and just upscales the output to 1080p..  i have attached couple more screen shots from built in feature of YouTube, ""Stats for nerd"" option.. and a screen grab from native Hotstar app with ""video details""..  both clearly shows that the native resolution of the panel is 720p but the video resolution is 1080p..  ridiculous how people are being cheated in daylight..  i hope someone has the technical expertise to understand what i am trying to explain..  and people buying Mi TVs please wake up and demand for proof, this is unacceptable..  i am pretty sure this review won't be published.."

2353,1,Worthless,"picture quality is average for cable SD channels, HD channels might work well... but don't expect the quality of samsung or sony.  patchwall OS and the content is all paid content, if u want to watch any content you have to pay for subscription.  build quality is average, sound quality is also average it's just loud not clear.  just go for samsung 4010 or higher version, like 4100.  No prime video support. don't fall for useless features."

I have trust on MI and yes it has fulfilled my all requirement, happy with the product but technician from jeeves associated with flipkart who came to installed this product was very arrogant. He treated me like i got this tv without paying any money. He didnt installed the tv properly, i asked another private technician to do this and paid some amount.i had panel to hang tv on my tv unit but Very badly he convinced me to buy their panel to hang tv, and he was scaring me to go for extended warranty, He literally showed me some videos having issues with Mi tv though i trust Mi i simply ignored him. Its very bad to screwed the name of any reputed and international brand and flipkart is doing this. Flipkart should work to overcome this problem, do teach them how to react with customers, how to have conversation with customers.  I hope no one should face this problem."

2439,5,Worth every penny,I have gone through the reviews and yes there are few issues that Mi needs to rectify. All in all with this price i think i do not have any complains. Request Mi to support the customers with issues faced. maybe a phone call will do some justice. you are a big brand and customer service is the need
2440,1,Utterly Disappointed,installation person not good very hurry up go to next place and not enough details given
2441,5,Just wow!,40 inches enough for master bedroom.
2442,5,Worth every penny,bast quality....
2443,4,Pretty good,"1. sound quality ok 2. display also good as per price, built quality of panel is quite disappointed. 3. connectivity seems good, unless ports are difficult to reach after installed."
2444,4,Worth the money,"This TV is a nice product but it's acessceries is a little bit costly i.e. wall mount, extended warranty etc."
2445,5,Mind-blowing purchase,very good product.
2446,5,Perfect product!,picture quality according to prize is great. Need an improvement in sound quality.
2447,4,Good choice,TV is good but there is no web browser
2448,5,Highly recommended,I bought two TV's. one is 32 inch and another is 43 inch. both TV's are MI. first time I was bit confused about these TV's. but after installation of these TV's I am really so happy with these products. thousands of thanks to Flipcart and MI.
2449,1,Unsatisfactory,Installation process is worst . A guy don't have a wall mount stand and it said it will install next day.after 3 day of delivery a tv is not installed .This should be worst thing for a brand like flipkart.
2450,5,Mind-blowing purchase,Best TV at this Price
2451,4,Very Good,Sound Quality is Awsm. The major problem i found was high resolution photos of dslr cannot be seen properly means the gets stuck too much when u want to see dslr images. Other than that features are too good and The price is just awsm as compared to Sony and Lg. Overall Value for money. ?
2452,5,Great product,I've issue with connecting tv from mobile use screencast.
2453,5,Just wow!,total paisa vasool tv ....everyone can go for it without hesitation ...
2454,4,Really Nice,good but installation service is poor
2455,4,Good quality product,Nice product worth of money Flipkart nice delivery
2456,4,Worth the money,"vfm purchase. only issue i am facing is if i continue watching video on sun nxt or hot star or zee5 , picture gets hanged aftersometime, which is need to exit and open again . though not a major breakthrough, its annoying to go back and open the app again. hope the software update address this issue"
2457,5,Must buy!,awesome thanks Flipkart
2458,5,Awesome,Fantastic product with affordable price. Couldn't ask for more. Picture quality is good. Only negative is inbuilt speakers which is expected though. You are in for a beast if you have sound bar connected to it😍

2468,3,Just okay,I m happy to buy mi led. Connectivity is osm
2469,5,Highly recommended,Preferred it for Mi's Quality.And it is.Worth product with reasonable price range.
2470,5,Terrific,the product is awesome worth of money and best in this range no problem in brightness and full compact tv in this range  but the problem lies in the installment services of flipcart that is not on time with me and the product is kept 3 days after delivered and the coustomer has to talk to flipcart and comany jeeves that install the tv
2471,5,Classy product,"Overall Good, best price"
2472,4,Worth the money,"worth for the money, need to see how it works after some months"
2473,5,Super!,Very Good TV.. Go for it..
2474,2,Not good,"picture quality is average, sound is good, screen mirroring is not working and still not solved, worst experience from mi engineers and flipkart customer support."
2475,2,Could be way better,new TV mirror casting not working this model new version Android 9
2476,5,Awesome,awsome purchase @ 15300...
2477,5,Worth every penny,I bought it for 16200/- Great Tv at this price
2478,1,Hated it!,One of the worst purchase in my life Don't purchase the product on Flipkart .if you want the TV purchase on mi showroom or any other shop.come with the manafacturing defect technician also accepted.but Flipkart don't replace the product and cancelled my rejection without reason....
2479,4,Nice product,Super Tv and Awesome sound qulity
2480,4,Really Nice,remote not working
2481,4,Good choice,"HDMI Auto display can be enabled by [1] Downloading the New System update from About option in Settings [2] After Downloading and rebooting the Mi TV,Under Inputs,the New option of STAY ON THE PREVIOUS SOURCE will be available and enabling this option can Start TV with Direct HDMI Auto display."
2482,4,Value-for-money,Just to mention that I am using this TV from 2nd Feb and based on that below is the detailed review  Best about this TV: Display is crisp and clear (Full HD as mentioned) Sound is loud with good base   Drawbacks about this TV: 1. You will not see much sound difference once the volume goes above 40-50 and it remains same but it's not less sound. 2. Chromecast connectivity is good but then subtitles which u see in your phone doesn't show up on TV. 3. WiFI connectivity keeps breaking and everytime u switch ON the TV you will have to connect to the WiFi. sometimes it even asks for Password again and again.  Overall one can go for the TV as the cons are just minor and can be fixed over the course time when updates comes. You can easily connect any device using cast and there is no issue at all
2483,5,Excellent,nice and perfect..
2484,5,Awesome,"Awesome TV.... Yesterday tv was installed... who ever wants to purchase this TV you might have some confusion and doubts about the TV...bcz when I want to purchase this TV even I also had the different doubts bcz various comments from users..here the my review..  you can blindly go with pro 43 series tv..and when it's comes to brightness isse.. useally in our homes to watch TV there will be certain brightness level will maintain, so that brightness (watchable) is equal to MI 43 pro 100% brightness...so if you want to increase due to some xyz reason ...there will no option..so for normal watching purpose there is no brightness issue... Actually MI should update this draw back feature.  sound - Awesome quality..you no need to connect extra speakers and woofers (speaker boxes) to enjoy the music...MI has super sound quality.  connectivity is good...and if you want to watch the tv through local cable dish also you can go to buy this..as I am using local cable network only...but please note abiously there will be difference ...but HD is quality is super.  hope this comment would help you to reduce the confusion about the brightness."

2500,2,Bad quality,Connectivity is very bad it connect but say no internet connection all are good but connectivity is important and that is very bad experience for me
2501,5,Simply awesome,This TV is worth every single Penny...You can not Complain for anything considering the Price Point. As Many people here are Complaining about Low Brightness...You Just need to 'Turn off' 'Dynamic Backlit'. Else everything works like Charm. If your budget is around 25K only...then definitely Go for it Without Thinking Twice.
2502,4,Good quality product,Value for money product
2503,5,Awesome,very nice
2504,1,Worst experience ever!,i have purchased TV and installation done after 5 days.. i am very much unhappy in Flipkart service.. especially.. their installation team called Jeevs.. i have past experience with jeevs.. very unprofisional team
2505,1,Utterly Disappointed,"Please do not buy this. You can contact ne personally if you want. All MI Smart TVs have huge internet issues. Read up about it. first 2 days it will function as expected and then suddenly you will start noticing that your WIFI starts dropping continuously. Every time you play an YouTube video/Prime video or any video actually, the wifi will drop and you will be signed out or something similar will happen. The bigger problem is that there is no solve for this. I have tried every single thing which could potentially work. It simply doesn't work. And there is no return policy for this TV, so they will maybe replace it and maybe not. Flipkart servicing when it comes to all this ia absolutely pathetic. Please think TWICE before considering this. I would strongly recommend against buying this pathetic TV."
2506,4,Delightful,very nice tv
2507,4,Wonderful,"TV sound,connectivity and picture quality is good. the only problem I found is that what it says in specs about the content partners. I will make you clear that many of the content partners will work through patchwall and not like an APP. so I find it difficult to search everytime. live TV from those content partners are also limited. thereby cutting there 1 star. TY"

2529,1,Waste of money!,Don't use this app. Flipkart sell your personal information to fraudsters and you will start getting fraud calls
2530,3,Decent product,"1)chromcast connection automaticaly disconnected, 2)miracast feature missing, 3)Realme devices not supported chromcast, 4)streaming full hd videos strucking and video and audio not sync"
2531,4,Delightful,"just got it. looks good. good services by flipkart and Jeeves. important is how long it last... after all it's Chinese product. anyhow it's performance is satisfactory. picture quality, sound quality will let the competitors in shame."
2532,1,Don't waste your money,Worst Product I ever purchased in Flipkart. Screen Mirroring options not working as my main motive of purchase is mirroring Only. Chrome cast option is given inbuilt but it is not working even Miracast also not working. Mainly the service engineer of this Mi is not very capable to clear this issue. Bad Bad Bad.
2533,1,Worthless,my mobile screen miror is not working
2534,2,Not good,"Sounds problem,"
2535,4,Good quality product,Exchanged it with my VU tv for android experience. Here are few things I would like highlight. 1 .If you're not into softwares and tweaking too much and just wanto have better TV experience just go for VU ultra smart. 2 .The display of this TV lags behind in quality to that of VU as you are able to see tints of blue instead of black (which was not the case in VU.) 3 .Theres definately an issue with in built wireless connectivity as it loses internet connection every now and then which wasn't the case with my previous tv. I had to connect it via Ethernet in the end. If you connect your bluetooth for audio the sound lags behind by a second or so. Overall an average TV hardware with great Patchwall 2.0 experience. hoping things for problem to get solved by an Update.
2536,4,Very Good,take more time to open and close
2537,5,Terrific,just woww... my all family members love it
2538,3,Good,mirror share not working mirror reflection problem
2539,2,Bad quality,"video is good but unable to control brightness , audio is very poor , connectivity very slow, my money wasted , every rupee is valuable for me, I'm from lower middle class, I'm saving money to purchase this from last 18 months, I'm too dissatisfied"
2540,1,Worst experience ever!,whole TV itself damaged. you have despatched a defective TV. I am just waiting for return and replacement. you have neither picked-up the product nor refunded my money. It occurred 48 hours before. After my repeated enquiry it is learned that you have taken initiative to replace the defective product. I have nothing more to explain because my history is self-explanatory.
2541,5,Terrific,nice TV nice picture quality 3 days delivery purchase by bajaj emi card nice experience
2542,5,Just wow!,very nice product thank you flipkart
2543,3,Does the job,1.not connected wifi display. 2.not connected home theater. big issue please consider my problem.
2544,5,Fabulous!,Super Tv
2545,4,Pretty good,Does not have support for Netflix and prime still.
2546,4,Very Good,"TV is good, but Ac3 audio is not supporting when playing movies from USB. Kindly suggest any solution for this"
2547,1,Worst experience ever!,good picture good sound simple user interface no lags overall a nice product. thank you mi and flipkart
2548,4,Good quality product,"Required a third party wifi connection for Screen Mirroring, But Except this issue everything is great."
2549,5,Simply awesome,"Superb Picture, Sound & Frame Quality. Amazing Product..."
2550,2,Not good,"Overall good product in terms of configuration and hardware.  Good ----------------------------- 1. Product build quality is good for the price range. 2. TV inbuild sound is good. 3. Can play videos in Full HD including 4K and 8K (Able to play in youtube). 4. Have a set of apps in play store for entertainment.  Bad ----------------------------- 1. Provided play store is having very few apps. 2. Most important no support for Google Chrome App. When installed from pen remote is not working and unable to operate the app. I tried installing Google Chrome, Opera, Netflix, Amazon Prime. 3. No Support for Amazon Prime videos also. 4. Built-in Chrome cast works for mobile but Laptop Google Chrome browser unable to find even though both are in the same network but using ES Explorer on TV I'm able to connect FTP Server running on my laptop and can transfer files as well.  Overall in my view considering all the negative and positive points of the TV it should be called a smart TV with minimal support to smart apps. At least it's not full android TV.  Better I will suggest buy a normal HD/Full HD TV and attach Fire Stick which will make your TV smarter than the Smart OS this TV provides and ask for more money.  Hope this review helps other to save money."
2551,5,Best in the market!,great experience to buy a television. thank you Flipkart! keep growing!
2552,1,Hated it!,"its very worst product if you want screen mirroring, its didn't working very bad connectivity. if u want screen mirroring dont buy this worst product"

2559,1,Worst experience ever!,mirror cast is not working.....please don't buy...
2560,3,Good,"Google assistance not working smoothly. sometimes you need to try multiple times then it acts , sometimes nothing happens. interface can be more better. you can not browse settings option or any other connectivity option while watching program. you need to close everything and go to home page and access setting or connectivity options."
2561,5,Best in the market!,Wow It's too Good. I am just loving it from Jagdish Naik - Margao- Goa
2562,5,Best in the market!,product is awesome but when i got the product i opened it myself and after opening it i called flipcart for query of warranty but they told that i should not plug in myself and now its warranty and replacememt policy lapsed. and if i do not install it by their service engineer then they will not provide any warrany
2563,1,Horrible,After 15 days of use My tv is not working. Hell lot of spark and smoke came out from it. Worst experience if my mother was not there at that time our house can caught fire its an very serious issue faced by me. I would like to hear from Mi.
2564,1,Useless product,TV is too slow. turning on and off itself takes more than.10 seconds. Apps get force close in its own. Videos does nt play smooth gets stuck
2565,4,Worth the money,Nice tv value for money thanks Flipkart
2566,5,Awesome,when connecting to the mobiles the sound is coming very less from the tv..and it is not connecting to the laptop even it is not showing as available device... that's it .... remaining are awesome
2567,1,Unsatisfactory,Don't buy TV from flipkart otherwise you will regret to buy from flipkart. Item delivered on time but installation & demo is too late. flipkart is tie up with 3rd class companies who doesn't care customer & time.
2568,3,Fair,There is an issue with the picture quality. There is colour imbalance and that makes the picture quality poor specially while watching sports. Other than that its an okaish kind of a product.
2569,5,Awesome,Good product
2570,2,Moderate,There are most important problem in this TV that TV mirror cast to mobile is not smoothly running and many times get stuck in running screen.I have returned this product and get replacement product but same issue face.I have done updation but not resolve.I think that this TV connectivity is not good.
2571,4,Wonderful,TV is good at this price.I got this for 15999 which is still high cause originally it was for 14000 or less .Sound quality awesome.picture quality is also good. SD set up box also look good on this screen.there is no need to get HD set up box if you have SD set up box. Just drawback I feel was that it take few minutes to start the TV everytime.
2572,4,Delightful,"Buy from mi store , jeeves expert is useless .. i had registered complaint on tv before few months , till now there is no further movements then i moved to mi store and registered complaint on tv , they had arrived and fix the problem by installing a new tv .

2581,1,Hated it!,"I bought an year back. and the TV was not working after an year (when the warranty period was completed). Flipkart is very worst, even they are not responding properly. Please do not buy these products in flipkart. Thanks!"

2604,3,Nice,"Overall performance is good...but there is problem in casting mobile screen to tv....unless and until both devices are not connected to same wifi, casting is not possible...where as in samsung tv there is no need tp connect to wifi, we can mirror the phone screen in a single tap without any delay in mirroring. I request to make an update with that option"
2605,2,Bad quality,"Sound quality is very bad For example - when bass comes up in any song ,movie etc the volume will goes low. Volume is not stable for bass. It should be stable at low nd high frequency.  Connectivity is very bad Screen mirroring is worst. There is a delay of 2 seconds in the tv,s screen comparison with the phone,s screen. when i play any type of video in my phone then there is a very high lag(hang) in every 4-5 seconds in tv,s screen. There is also small missprints in every 5-6 seconds."

Pros  Decent picture quality(in hd only) Smart and stylish Installation and demo was very helpful  Cons Taking more time start around 1min Wall mount and remote battery not provided Grief sound quality Should provide another option for connecting home theater Bluetooth not working"

Micro USB to HDMI also not connect with mobile. USB Pen drive also not connect and not stream continously. Also tv sometimes stops automatically, I am having VU its connectivity is very fine. I don't recommend this TV due to its poor connectivity."
2727,5,Highly recommended,MI TV is awesome thing..at this price...You can expect according to the price... Very good picture quality and Excellent connection with WiFi... every thing about this TV is good but some people giving bad rating ignore them..go for it...keep in mind that installation and demo services is slow for this..TV..so you need to wait for the installation 4 to 6 days after delivery.. Flipkart need to concentrate on that service engineer and agencies...

2729,4,Really Nice,It's too awesome😇😇💝💝❤️😘🎶🎥🎥
2730,1,Horrible,"looks like not a new TV, and picture clarity is not good."
2731,4,Worth the money,"the tv is great. its absolutely value for money. the sound and picture is good. all apps can be streamed through (amazon prime, alt balaji, eros now, zee5 ). although netflix still doesnt work even after the update. but we use screen mirroring app to watch all these shows as it consumes less data. we haven't yet got wifi setup installed and through screen mirroring , jio's 1.5gb of each of our phones is enough.the installation and delivery was very quick. professional who came for installing it was polite."
2732,3,Does the job,TV is good but installation is bad

2738,4,Delightful,10/10 For the product 3/10 For the installation  Good for the price. Picture quality is awesome. Sound is also nice. Supports Android. Good for bedroom.  The installation guy was really bad. He even don't know how to operate an Android tv. he didn't inform the company about the installation.The TV was delivered on 1st march. He came on 2nd and wall mounted the tv. Later they called us and said that ur product will not be covered under warranty bcz our engineer haven't installed ur TV yet. Later my mom called the installation guy but he ignored that he came on 4th n installed the tv. Seems to me that he forgot it. Later I called to flipkart. 2 days later I got an email regarding the installation.Flipkart resolved the problem.Now it is showing that my TV was installed on 11th.

2814,4,Delightful,"The 1st thing i have to say is that in this price it is very nice,don't compare it with LG, Samsung or Sony because you are paying just half.But overall for a basic user it is the best tv.Best TV for those who have tight budget and basic uses."
2815,5,Mind-blowing purchase,A GooD Product on this budget.
2816,5,Highly recommended,Awesome Product of MI.
2817,2,Expected a better product,"can't control the brightness/contrest/colors And poor display quality , Waste of money"
2818,5,Super!,"very very good product, value for money, 4k support, USB pendrive support, note card reader support,"
2819,1,Useless product,"i have purchased Tv on Mach after 3 month TV has no any picture, I have complain about prob MI care and Flip cart but 15 days may prob is not slove, not buy online like this type of product not any help from flipcart also.very bad product of MI"
2820,5,Brilliant,osm product ??
2821,3,Decent product,its ok not good not bed in this price range
2822,3,Fair,"Screen mirroring (screen cast) not Working , only Google Chromecast working, no personal image Screen Saver only 2 inbild image only Available Screen Saver. Typing Key options wast , otherwise Good."
2823,3,Good,Poor display and build quality TV.
2824,5,Terrific purchase,As expected... Mi pro 4A a good Android tv at a very good price... Really value for the money..
2825,3,Nice,"picture quality not that great, Flipkart delivered very quick and installation is worst they took more than 3 days"
2826,5,Wonderful,amazing experience
2827,1,Utterly Disappointed,picture quality not good
2828,4,Good choice,The installation person fitted a stabilizer in the input saying that no inbuilt stabilizer in the TV it protects from external surge. charged 1650/- extra.which needs clarification from mi TV that stabilizer is required or not.
2829,5,Perfect product!,picture & sound quality excellent.. normal brightness issues but no issues. best deal in this price segment love u mi.. 👍
2830,1,Absolute rubbish!,Ghatiya TV Bluetooth doesn't work with soundbar video shuts without reason no proper testing done by Xiaomi Pathetic purchase don't buy
2831,1,Absolute rubbish!,I got the defective product and when I inform about the issue than flipkart told me they can't replace the product. Still facing issues it get hang after few hours of operation and also facing issue with Bluetooth connection. Please resolve if you guy care a bit about your customers.
2832,2,Slightly disappointed,Vision is very poor Poor connectivity however price is very low but item is not preferable
2833,5,Perfect product!,"After 1st day, tv is awesome. I have read some review about brightness issue, but trust me brightness is fantastic, comparable with any branded tv. Sound quality is also very good. After all, if the food is good, plate quality or plate name does not matter."
2834,5,Worth every penny,good product........ picture good
2835,1,Worthless,The picture quality was very dull and the screen mirroring was very worst total waste of money. The picture resolution was automatically decreasing worst product. F*****g tv
2836,1,Don't waste your money,Home setup (patch Wall) wast bad. My tv fall down. Wifi connection is very bad..
2837,1,Waste of money!,Bad

2839,5,Perfect product!,superb TV 👌
2840,5,Awesome,very nyc
2841,1,Horrible,Soo poor product dont buy waste age of money
2842,4,Very Good,wall mounting kit not provided
2843,4,Pretty good,There is no auto-play option for AV connect till date.. Please update as soon as possible..
2844,1,Worthless,"No support for netflix and prime video. Network speed is worst. Worst TV. Rs.23,000 Wasted. Return is not eligible"
2845,1,Absolute rubbish!,"MI 43 4A PRO has bug 1. When use directly power off then ON , TV will not start automatically. User has to switch on button from TV or Remote. 2. Every time user need to select AV1 every time using remote,which difficult for common person. And it will not preserve last source. With such bugs using TV is tedious and non-friendly. 3. Non-Friendly for elder users or illiterate user.."
2846,1,Horrible,led penal problum
2847,1,Utterly Disappointed,"I am writing this review after 2 years of use of this LED TV. On completion of just 2 years and 1 month the display of this unit goes faulty and screen blanked. On calling MI's customer care several days, finally two technicians came and without much diagnosis concluded that the LED panel is faulty and will cost around 17K to change the led panel. I asked them to repair this unit itself but they didn't have such option. They also charged visiting fee for doing nothing. Worse after sales service ever experienced. Now I have no other option but to discard this and buy another new TV."
2848,4,Delightful,Simply awesome... Go for it if ur budget is low 🤗🤗
2849,5,Classy product,VERY NICE TV
2850,4,Nice product,Good but little bit connectivity problem is there
2851,5,Perfect product!,It's been now 5 Months I am using this TV. To be honest it is the best value for money product in the market. If you have very stringent budget then just go for it. Don't waste time on research as I already did before getting this TV.  You really don't nees to those couple of extra features which other reputed brands are providing at much higher price. This TV has got everything that you need in a TV.
2852,5,Terrific,Bad
2853,1,Not recommended at all,"Worst product....plz do not buy this TV. Flipkart is also not supporting. Jus bought this couple of months back and we hv experienced a technical problem. Tv is not getting switched on. It is showing only MI symbol after switched on, however it is not going further. Stucked there and not getting switched on. Contacted flipkart, no positive support from Flipkart also."
2854,3,Decent product,Only issue is Bluetooth connection issue..as it's automatically disconnect after few minutes...also sound is not high is Bluetooth connection
2855,1,Useless product,Faltu product cheap quality i request to all don't buy this Tv.

2868,2,Moderate,connectivity is very poor also not casting properly

2870,1,Horrible,"it's worst product, I ever purchased in flipcart, just after 2 months problem with picture tube & display, tried to contact MI care, they never ever responded from last one month. pay money and forget about warenty. Just waste of money for this product. better purchase some better brand even on higher price"
2871,5,Wonderful,nice led tv
2872,1,Worst experience ever!,I bought Mi 43 inch on 30th May. And in the very first month of June 25 onwards it started some problem. The TV started blinking but this problem doesn't last for long time so that I can lodge a complain and demand a technician. Please viewers don't buy mi led smart tv. It's a request
2873,5,Brilliant,awesome product valve for money...!!! good delivery ...!!! but installation and demo process had huge time taken for my area...!!! there about have take 10 to 15 days...!!! installation process rating very poor...!!!

2882,5,Wonderful,"Excellent but i have issue with remote that it dose not working, but flipkart gives me compensation. Like service. Overall TV is full paisa vasul in low budget."
2883,3,Does the job,"Delivery of product is good. BUT the return/exchange of old TV policy is not good. As per site your return policy is old product is shown ANY BRAND + size. NOT SHOWN IS RUNNING OF ANY OTHER DESCRIPTION. My Old TV 21"" inch LG Golden Eye plus is running condition but display of picture is atleast Half in the screen. Ekart executive has not agree to exchange this problem. He has received Total cost of MI 43""LED tV of Rs. 23000/- by cash. My request to collect the payment by debit card. But he is not agree/clear is the same. My opinion the exchange of old product is return as per purchase exchange policy. Unnecessary dilemma condition make to that time. Please check."
2884,4,Wonderful,fine quality
2885,5,Classy product,awesome
2886,5,Mind-blowing purchase,Superbbbbbbb smart TV picture quality soo good value for money mi is a No1 brand. Thanku flipkart
2887,5,Awesome,superb
2888,5,Terrific,value for money
2889,4,Worth the money,4A pro like 4A .But Connection between my phone to TV(miracast) is more difficulty compare to 4A.
2890,5,Wonderful,A very good product for the price. Contrast is a small issue but manageable. Connectivity is little slow as compared to other brands like bravia but if you compare the pricing you will find out its fine. The technician are not well trained. they tell you very less about the features of the TV so you need to find out on your own.
2891,5,Worth every penny,Best video quality and also sound quality.
2892,1,Utterly Disappointed,"input source HDMI most of the times only audio coming, Bluetooth audio very noisy. Given request for replacement."
2893,4,Delightful,problem to connect with mirror casting...
2894,5,Worth every penny,Everything fine but not able to download apps from play store.
2895,5,Best in the market! Go for it.,"Awesome Brand with Quality. For Flipkart, I gave 5 ***** for Give us Quality and Genuine Product. For MI, Simply Superb."

2900,4,Nice product,Ok
2901,5,Wonderful,Tv quality is excellent... Just installation takes to much time almost 22 days to be completed after delivery... Other wise everything great
2902,5,Highly recommended,Nice Product
2903,5,Awesome,Good job.
2904,1,Unsatisfactory,Writing comment after 2 years because today it stopped working itself. Screen stops working after some minutes of switch on.
2905,5,Brilliant,Thank you Flipkart
2906,5,Brilliant,32 inch led tv nice products
2907,5,Terrific purchase,Good Value for money but MI should provide wall stand with TV
2908,5,Simply awesome,Beautiful Product.. Sound is great.. Picture quality is above average.. Service by Flipkart is best.. Got at best price.. Flipkart Cobrand Credit will give you too much discount.. Overall Best-Buy..❤
2909,2,Bad quality,Their is and issue in sound so my request is you to come and check the sound of tv its to slow then any other tv sound even its sometime high volume and automatically its slow volume its default piece so kindly come and check my tv otherwise I will complain to other for this type of sound which you are giving From Janmesh Maniyar
2910,1,Terrible product,this product display not clarty & spekers resound please give me tv amount
2911,1,Utterly Disappointed,LED light failure after one year of usage. Worst quality
2912,4,Wonderful,"Overall good to use, you can’t expect much more in this budget"
2913,3,Decent product,"Microsoft teams not working , also Flipkart team don't have solutions on insurance pls take advance insurance before buying. Return have to much issues so don't take replacement for old product s they charge us at the time of delivery and reject products. Pls use another apps"
2914,5,Must buy!,Value for money 💰
2915,2,Moderate,The Installation'Guy' was very bad at work. Some how he finish his work. Hook Tv in wall with only the one screw. Not even the sign in to mi account. Simply he cheated with the senior home person.
2916,5,Best in the market!,Value of money after there year working. Fine
2917,4,Worth the money,"I have been using this TV for a couple of weeks now A few things that I miss or do not like are:  1. There could be one touch button for Youtube on the remote since it is one of the most used platforms  2. There could be one touch button for switching to HDMI as well. The elderly members who are not that technically sound would find it really challenging to switch from OTT to cable/dish. Its take many clicks and navigation to switch  3. Booting time might frustrate you at times. Easily it will take 45-60 seconds from the time you switch on and reach the channel you wanted to watch  4. Need to wait for 4-5 seconds after you click the voice recognision button for it to start recording. By that time you would have said your command twice already.  Few things which are good  1. Nice color quality 2. For OTT and other platforms, voice quality and reach is very good"
2918,4,Really Nice Product,Very Good product for a middle class family. worth buying it
2919,5,Worth every penny,This item is very super sound and picture 1080qulity
2920,2,Expected a better product,"Good product at low price, picture and sound are according to price. But main concern is after few days tv operation will be slow. Not sure if need to format or reset to get it resolved"
2921,4,Value-for-money,Picture and sound quality are good.Delivery and installation were as per schedule.Color reproduction of display little bit dull otherwise a good product expecting the product to last long and MI building a long lasting relationship with us.
2922,5,Classy product,"It has been one year, I had gifted this TV to my parents.. The picture quality,sound quality, sound level and the connectivity is fantastic. I am over satisfied with this TV.."
2923,3,Decent product,Nice working
2924,4,Worth the money,"Good one, easy operative, good quality,"
2925,1,Terrible product,"Delivered on time. But installation was too late. And installation team is worst. Installation people behaviour was not acceptable. They were behaving like they are the owner of the product and they will install the product when they don't have any other work, till the time of installation let people wait for them. It was a bad experience I had from flipkart. I am not interested anymore to do purchase from flipkart and also I ll be suggesting everyone not to purchase from flipkart."

2957,5,Wonderful,It working till date. I am loving it. Awesome product A+
2958,4,Pretty good,Good experience but sound quality could have been better
2959,1,Cheaters,"Demo and installation is free but engineer asked 399 rupees for wall mount,cheating company flip cart"
2960,3,Nice,Tv is good but expected a better picture quality
2961,1,"Beware of ordering in flipkart, wasted my 13k.","Been more than a week and still not installed but return period is over. Now i understood the reason why people say about flipkart service. Experiencing it now, time to switch to better website. I am afraid that now TV is not working, unable to return at same time wasted my 13k. Beware of flipkart and installation service. Do you want to save 500 bucks ordering in flipkart and lose peace of mind, then you are in right place. Have a great day ordering in flipkart."
2962,2,Moderate,Average Product.. Not to my expectations

2973,3,Does the job,Overall good but bite slow
2974,5,Highly recommended,Item delivery was very fast. But installation & demo is very bad. It is toomuch time taken to install
2975,2,Bad quality,Screen Mirriorig option is not there. Cast option is there but not working properly.
2976,4,Worth the money,Working well android application allows you to download multiple applications.
2977,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"I have been delivered within 2 days after demand. It is tremendous, i am enjoying it's all new features which gives us a experience of a pvr. Amazing. Loving it."
2978,2,Moderate,"There was connectivity issues when tv is in standby or in sleep mode. Tv main power should be switched off and on again to work. Built in Chromecast also not working as expected, connectivity issues."
2979,4,Wonderful,Its good
2980,4,Delightful,The picture quality and over all look is excellent accept the sound quality. Sound is very interior and it seems there is absolutely no bass effect even not comparable to normal old TV. Pls think if you are going for good sound.
2981,4,Good quality product,"Very happy to buy it, delivery on time, using since 7-8 months no problem has been seen so far. Even if you don't have recharge in your set top box you can enjoy connecting your hotspot. The only issue I've faced till now is that its response sometimes lags while controling it via remote. That's why I've given 1 star less otherwise i would've given 5 star. ALL THE BEST 👍🏻"
2982,4,Delightful,Good but sounds less than my old MI led tv
2983,5,Best in the market!,"Product is fine, but the person came for installation was not much aware of the product."
2984,4,Really Nice,"TV is good, but they charged around 1850 for wall mount installation. They had two types of wall mount facility, one of Each. 500 was not good and this one was too expensive. The amount that I saved as TV discount, got washed off in this installation"
2985,1,Don't waste your money,Worst tv it's not supported with my cpu pendrive also not supported
2986,1,Very poor,Pathetic... exactly after 2years it is showing panel problem..i mean exactly after the warranty finished... disgusting mi tv.. I'll never ever purchase mi products.
2987,3,Decent product,"I don't have much issue with tv but it's with flipkart, if you give 10 days exchange offer, you should allow change in tv brand as well. After getting tv I felt it was small and thought it would be better if I can chnage it to 40 - 42 Inch tv, but flipkart don't give you that option. Even with exchange I need to stick with same brand and same tv size att least you can allow bigger size in same brand. Tv is ok"
2988,2,Not starting after 1 month after purchage.,"It is not starting after 1 or 2 month, it is looking for internet connectivity and not starting, sound quality is not good."
2989,4,Worth the money,"Do not purchase wall mount from installation boy . Its a waste of money , its take 400 rs but u purchase from other third party application they provide better than instalation boy"

2994,5,Awesome,Best
2995,5,Highly recommended,Good
2996,5,Simply awesome,Good
2997,5,Simply the best in this price range,"Initially, I was very skeptical about buying TV from brands other than LG or SAMSUNG, but to my surprise, this tv has got a lot more features than those brands and the picture quality and sound are equally good.  Pros:  MI Patchwall (Best UI for a Smart TV) Picture/Sound quality (20w speakers are loud enough for a small room) Connectivity (2 USB, 3 HDMI, WIFI, and inbuilt Chromecast) Can play 4k videos seamlessly   Cons:  Bezels are slightly thick compared to the Horizon model, but that's not a concern at all. Takes up to 1-2 minute for booting up which is annoying sometimes  Overall rating 5/5 and very happy with the product"
2998,5,Best in the market!,Great one at great price. Smart n sleek.
2999,1,Did not meet expectations,"Internet connectivity not working fine , also casting not working , complaint several times , no support provided to fix or return the product from Flipkart"
0,1,Worst experience ever!,Worst product of Mi . Not satisfied at all with this product . Brightness is very low like local made company led . Don’t go for this add more budget in this and go for brands like sony and LG .. led panel of the this Led is worst. Bad experience with mi and Flipkart both . Flipkart shouldn’t sell these kind of worst product 😡😡. Mi balo pese barbad ho gye tmhare product pr 😡
1,1,Not 100% Smart TV from Flipkart,"It's not recommended to any one as lot of specification game from Flipkart as well as MI. Lot of online streaming channels not support to this TV. Better you go with other brand which support any online web streaming platform. TRUST, this will not meet your expectation, if you genuinely looking for smart TV."
2,1,Hated it! This Tv has issues with connecting to Wifi .,"This tv has a big problem with wifi connection.  A typical frustration case:  Mi Tv 4A pro has issue with connecting to wifi( typically 2.4GHz and 5GHz space) . If I connect Mi Tv to Personal hotspot of mobile it works fine. But If i connect to wifi( any wifi ranges from 2.4GHz and 5GHz space -tried with 5 Wifi networks ) its connecting to wifi but shows no internet access. Even after connecting only 3 to 4 minutes internet will work after that it says "" ""Wifi has no internet access"" But connection remains same.  If I do deep clean and then reconnect to wifi the internet will work for 2 to 3 mins after that tv says ""you have connected to wifi that has no internet access""  Example: After connection youtube app works only for two or three minutes later you tube will not work similar with all apps.  Note: The same wifi network will works fine in Mobile/Laptop but not in Mi tv. Also called network engineer to test and ensure no issue with wifi all settings are correct.   so in summary whats the problem??   1. Not connecting to wifi internet- "" Mi tv 4a pro will connect to wifi but it says no internet access""  What i tried to fix it by calling Mi customer care and their advice.  1. Deep cleaned tv via Tv manager app- Not solved my problem 2. Update the android to latest version - Not solved my problem 3. Done factory reset - Not solved my problem 4. Checked Network settings like , DHCP, etc .. selected DHCP everting is fine - but not solved my problem."
3,1,Worst Installlation Service provided,"I wish to know if all those who buy this TV from Flipkart, how good and quick installation service was available from the supporting technical team after delivery? The product was delivered on 8th feb and I was informed about installation on 9th feb. Surprisingly, i never got any information and just waited till evening. then I wrote to them and have been a chain mail of sorry and taking actions since then. I wonder, because even after raising the issue since 7-8 days for 1 whole week, Flipkart customer care calls to check whether the installation was done, service provider asks the same question, 'when they can come' and take a time, make you wit at home and never come, call or inform. Again the same routine next day, flipkart office calls to know, then to apologize, then to ask for the last 24 hrs and again note being able to solve it. This is really the routine I have lived with this whole week. I had also paid for 2 years extended warranty, but now, it seems that money might be going to flipkart for free because they have no control on providing a professional service of a simple installation, how would they ever provide warranty related service. If they ever need to sustain in large appliance sale, they need professional service partners, nor unprofessional morons who break their own promise not one but multiple times to make the customer suffer. I have a sincere suggestion to all those fellow customers buying r planning to buy big appliances, be very careful about the service response promptness available in your area as I am not staying in a remote location, I am staying in a metro set-up, capital of a large state. To make it feel worst, i am also the plus member and a very old customer, may be 8-9 years. Please be careful"
4,1,Absolute rubbish!,"you are buying full HD tv, but pathwall is designed to operate as half HD only, screen resolution is full HD, but processor is not fast enough, so MI designed pathwall to operate at half HD. if you want to watch dth, then half HD fullfill ur criteria as no dth provider provide resolution of full hd, but if u want to use apps like netflix, prime, hotstar, max u will be getting half hd, if u attach firestick and try to watch full HD, then processor wont support and display will not be smooth. All existing customers can try it once, run any movie which provide fast moving arial view. u will observe some discontinuity in motion. so screen is full HD but you wont be able to watch Full HD in any possible case"
5,1,Don't waste your money,"as they mentioned it is not a smart tv . it doesnt support prime,netflix,hotstar VU tv is better than this dont buy this tv. worst flipkart support, actually i am a big worst tvfan of flipkart . i have 600+ coins in flipkart .. but from now i dont support flipkart flatform"
6,1,Very poor,"I feel not to buy this smart TV as this wil not work on WiFi. after several update, restatry, coordination with call center, unable work on WiFi mode especially in YouTube & prime video. only work on Ethernet cable. in WiFi TV hangs & need to restart both TV & router. through Ethernet cable video quality is good."
7,1,Terrible product,Please dont buy TV will not work more than 1 year.. I purchased TV in August 2020 but I may 2021 TV is not working. I buy that protection plan also for 3 years complained there but still no one come to check this is july month now. For that flipkart also not helping giving only dates dates & dates...... All are liers....
8,1,Horrible,"Good products this price range, amazing performance Sounds to good Picture quality best Remote so unique All over best TV One problem TV on like everytime android logo bootup After 8 months TV automatically turn off not turn on , very bad experience"
9,1,Don't waste your money,very worst product it's smart tv but jugad tv lot of connectivity but nothing works smooth n perfect it's just basic tv which have chromecast which just allows u to cast only through Google products it's pure google product don't buy if u want smart tv
10,1,Terrible product,"Don't buy mi products. They seem to work normally at the starting but as months go by they don't work properly like the apps crash frequently, internet connectivity issues, bluetooth connectivity issues.... Look the price is low but this is not the product you want if you are planning for a long term basis. These mi products have a worst piece of software full of bugs ... Therefore I don't recommend buying this tv"
11,1,Worst experience ever!,they sould work on connectivity .. picture quality is good in this price not that great but good. Its a good package in android smart tv. I can say that with patchwall in it giving edge to this mi 4a pro in this price range against all its contemporaries.
12,1,Not recommended at all,It proves that less cost means low quality...tv is overall ok..but lots connectivity issue...does not stay connected more than 5 min..every time you have to connect with wifi... You tube and other apps are also very slow..even i have to restart so many times...but my previouse tv was good enough... They are now started selling garbage now...dont buy... casting is not working yet... Moreover it is a normal tv..not smart tv...topi pehna dia mi ne...
13,1,Worst display quality.... ever seen ...,I don't know. How this TV got this many number of buyers. the quality of display is worst. Not even 'below average'. Horrible. Since I have exchanged my old LED tv with this. I don't have the option to exchange with any other brand. My old LED tv has very good display compared to this.
14,1,Useless product,Led is working fine but install technician is non skilled. He don't know how to On the power of led tv. He declared that LED tv is faulty. But TV is working ok
15,1,Not recommended at all,Screen Mirroring is not ok. It play through app links like as internet browsing on tv. it only collects links via mobile through the apps supported in tv nothing else. while Samsung not require to connect with internet and works on screen mirroring with all our local media files and photos etc.
16,1,Hated it!,Please do not buy this tv. The display will be damaged after 1 year completed. If you purchase complete protection plan with this product for 3 year. They do not provide good service. I bought this tv with complete protection plan. They took my tv but didnt refund my amount yet. So please do not buy this type of product ever. I have a worst experience with this product.
17,1,Very poor,The only thing I would like to say about the product is it's a smart TV with no smart features. Connectivity is really pathetic. Basic LED TV is far better than this so called smart TV. Complete waste of money
18,1,Worthless,"Don’t buy MI LED Smart TV 4A Pro, I have purchased this tv on Jan 21, 2019 and giving this review. 1. Getting restarts by tv itself like MI phones 2. Loud beep sound coming after every 30 mins of using tv. 3. Brightness issue. 4. Neither Mi Company or Flipkart doesn’t care if issue comes or not because they are not ready to give replacement. They have only 10 days replacement. 5. Mi company gives only assure that product will work fine after repaired. But am not sure this tv will work fine after repaired also bcz in a span of one month am facing these many issues.  Guys pls don’t buy this tv or any MI products, its waste of money."
19,1,Did not meet expectations,"Worst TV... as usual like MI phones, MI TVs also having only one plus point which is low price... MI's only motive is to give all the features in low price.. anyway that's a good idea... but wat about the quality of the products... low build quality low remote quality low connectivity quality.. everything this below average performance... display is somewhat good... but all other things is worst... If u r looking for a android TV don't go for MI... you can by VU.. of course VU is bit costlier than MI. but u will not have these issues... end of all money is matters... how much money u pay that much quality product u will get. I made a mistake... I should not buy mi... I should go for vu... vu is far better than mi"
20,1,Did not meet expectations,Please don't go with this product if you really like to see with good sound. The sound quality is very poor. The background sound will be very high and dialogues will be very low. Whatever settings you do it remains same.. better choose wisely.
21,1,Useless product,"This tv is so outdated ! 1 gb ram is not enough to run apps smoothly ! Picture quality is good in FHD , but in this rate one can buy a 4k tv in other brands."
22,1,Useless product,"Installation is not done yet, scheduled twice. After making calls many time, I was informed by the technician that it would take 2 or 3 days more as wall mount stand is not in stock. Ho gyi aisi tessi excitement ki. Better to buy it from mi directly. Almost 3 out of 4 customers have complained against jeeves. Why don't u take care of it as still there is no improvement in this regard"
23,1,Hated it!,Picture quality is not upto mark. I have one Micromax TV have excellent quality in same D2H connection. Even though it is 6 years old not a smart TV but Micromax is much much better than MI.  connect with phone also not much good  I will rate it 2/10 only.  Waste of money
24,1,Unsatisfactory,"cast screen connectivity is very very poor, once it's connected to your mobile then it will take 5 to 10 second to deliver picture on TV Picture quality is very poor, if you have normal set top box then you must buy HD set top box overall it's a HD ready TV I think Micromax led TV is better than MI in order to picture quality."
25,1,Worst experience ever!,NYC tv install is good miraz is also good person he is very gud engineer and tv also gud product I so very lucky I choose mi led tv thanks flipkart
26,1,Worthless,This MI branded TV is absolutely average. I bought it over other comparable brands like TCL or Toshiba trusting them MI brand and service Center network.  1.The remote control has Spartan controls so it is very difficult to navigate through available features and basic input options.  2. The picture quality is below average with poor brightness even at maximum setting  3. Sound fidelity is inferior to other comparable TV brand and one needs to crank up the volume for better audio. That causes corresponding increase in noise  Buying this TV seems like a poor decision on hindsight considering that the product cannot be returned unless there is a manufacturing defect.
27,1,Did not meet expectations,Everything is good and I like the TV. I purchase this led tv for his Google Chromecast feature and google assistance. It's make some trouble when we connect Tv to mobile. Sometime it's show and sometime it's not show in mobile. Otherwise all is good. Sound quality and picture quality is more better than Samsung led.
28,1,Not recommended at all,"It is an android tv but doesn't support the most important apps like Netflix and Prime, So no point in buying without this content provider being supported, I could see other tv brands below this price range are providing this basic features and also once you buy the tv you can not open it immediately, you need to wait for the installation and I waited for a week for it. I would say it is basic tv."
29,1,Don't waste your money,"This is worth with this price but Im not much satisfied due to performance of the tv. Sometimes the tv is restarting when we teying to connect other wifi network. Also if you switched on your tv then you need to wait for 2 to 3 mins to open, its like a mobile device. But in my view tv should be switched on when we turn on the tv, we should not wait for more than 3 mins to see the picture. Wifi network is not refreshing if we turn any new wifi device. Screen mirroring is very worst, playing li... READ MORE"
30,1,Utterly Disappointed,"satisfied with the product , overall a good experience at this price . obviously there will a difference if you spend more however for price conscious person it's absolutely great TV with all lastest features. though you can't compare it with brands like Sony and all"
31,1,Terrible product,this TV is a like a normal led TV and not a smart TV. No app is running smoothly. there is a lot of hanging and connectivity issues in almost all the apps. My other iffalcon smart led TV is running smoothly on the same WiFi network. so just a normal TV for me nothing smart in it. flipkart please return or refund this product. A horrible experience this time with flipkart
32,1,Don't waste your money,"Worth of money. Best in this price. Video quality is quite good, as par with brands like Lg, thomson, onida etc but nt compareable with sony or samsung. Default sound is nt dat good but with change in settings nice sound. Connectivity is superb with built in chromecast. Amazon prime and netflix have to be installed using pen drive. Overall grt experience."
33,1,Absolute rubbish!,"I ordered the tv on oct 14th and got the product on 31st october, and that too after making 6 enquiry calls and 1 visit to the satellite hub in my town. Only when i visited the hub i came to know that there was some issue with the barcode. The product worked good for just few days and then started to get switch off automatically. When i requested for replacement on the 9th day from the day of delivery, they refused to replace and was saying that only repair is possible. I had to make another 3-4 calls to make the replacement happen. Apart from this, i also purchased a skirt and 3 tops out of which all were of poor quality. In short i just want to say that providing customers with damaged and low quality products during sale on offer is not suitable for a reputed online shopping site like Flipkat. So please keep up your standards."
34,1,Terrible product,"Voice is pretty poor on Hdmi worst tv i've ever brought plz dont buy mi tv, its so complicated and not at all user friendly a new user will find a laptop much more easier to handle and underatnd than this tv. even the technician who came to sort the problem said he cant do anything, this tv brand doenst have great voice, need to up the volume to 70% to hear voice clearly no wonder they sell this tvs for such cheap, did a big mistake ac3 format doesnt play on this tv, u cant change the sound mode or pic mode while playing a movie thru a pendrive, need to go back, back and back forever why cant they give a normal user friendly remote you cant even play the next video while a watching the current one, coz they skipped all the buttons, u need to go back and then play the next. voice is biggest problem is this tv, plz dont go for it, i made a mistake, hope others dont"
35,1,Terrible product,"The sound quality is really bad. I found and followed many tutorials and forums describing how to tune the sound for Mi TVs, but even then the sound quality remained bad. Lot of forums suggested to use external speakers however, they also describe that the TV is compatible or works better only with specific speakers. Some also suggest the bad sound quality is because it has speakers under the TV, and works better when placed it on a table instead of hanging on the wall. Not happy at all with the purchase."
36,1,Terrible product,The Mr.Perfect Tv  Everything was superb every spec in Tv is fabulous.Picture quality is so good youtube at 1080p is perfectly playing.Sound was clear and loud enough and android operating system is so good and in-built chromecast was good enough to cast.Delivery and installation was done in the same day.
37,1,Horrible,"quality of products is too bad. very less bright ness . we can't increase contrast, bright ness . sharpness. connectivity very poor . MI is the real CHINESE product. after brought this you will feel. this is the reason there is no cancelations only replacement . after replace you will get same product. i check with technician . quality is very poor . don't believe chinese product and supporter like flipkart. after purchase you have to use or throw ."

I have tested with all sources ( set top box, videos from pendrive, youtube, hotstar, zee5). The result was same , i requested for replacement. The mi Authoriesed technician has visited to check if the problem was real, he approved that complaint was real. Our replacement request was accepted. I felt glad that the problem would be solved with the new tv. They delivered the new tv, but the same problem exists . I think all mi tvs have the same problem of improper sync between audio and video. Today I got an update , i expected that the problem would be resolved with this update, but all my hopes went in vain. The problem still exists. I am no longer interested in again requesting for replacement or return. Because i know that it's a difficult process. And i know that all mi tvs have same problem. So every one please do check if there is same problem with your mi tv, please raise a complaint and mi company will resolve this issue with an ota update."

These people are totally irresponsible, as I received the on 6th April, and till 14th no installation was done. Everyday customer care calls are just horrible and everyday I had to explain my problem to them. But still they couldn't arrange for the installation at all. Never buy MI products from Flipkart.

75,1,Useless product,"I got delivery of TV today. Installation Engineer arrived and tried to make settings.

He was making so many calls to customer care in return he was asked to send some videos of the problem showing no connection. After all this exercise remained continue till 7:00 pm and finally he declared that TV has some manufacturing problem.  Now TV is lying at my home waiting for reverse pick. I am amazed to see how defective/uninspected product can be dispatched to the customer. Come on Xiaomi it was not expected, it was my 1st ever purchase of MI brand product and unfortunately I will neither buy nor recommend Mi to anyone.

96,1,Horrible,"Bad products, lags alot, 1 gb ram is too low for even a 720p tv let alone a 1080p TV, also the 40 inch TV is not really 1080p, It comes with 720p preset, you can change it to 1080p with a few tweaks with your laptop/computer but it would invite many faults and glitches. I would suggest you not to do it, also if you can return it then do it asap and don't buy a tv with 1080p resolution/40 inch/ 43 inch regardless of any company, rather then that buy a HD ready/32 inch tv cause the performance will be the same in both or else look for a TV that comes with at least 2 gb ram."

This is my second try to educate people on the scam that Mi is doing selling cheap TVs in India, my first review was taken down by FK and Mi sighting pointless reasons..  Here is my another try, and hopefully won't go in vain (again)  it's been almost an year since I bought this TV, till date i regret everyday.. bcoz i was cheated in daylight by both FK and Mi on the specifications of the TV, no one has the technical expertise nor the proper knowledge to understand the real issue, which is quite unfortunate..  The panel is 720p and just upscales the output to 1080p..  i have attached couple more screen shots from built in feature of YouTube, ""Stats for nerd"" option.. and a screen grab from native Hotstar app with ""video details""..  both clearly shows that the native resolution of the panel is 720p but the video resolution is 1080p..  ridiculous how people are being cheated in daylight..  i hope someone has the technical expertise to understand what i am trying to explain..  and people buying Mi TVs please wake up and demand for proof, this is unacceptable..  i am pretty sure this review won't be published.."
103,1,Useless product,Installation is very bad.even I have spent 500 extra for their wall mount. Not satisfied
104,1,Worthless,"picture quality is average for cable SD channels, HD channels might work well... but don't expect the quality of samsung or sony.  patchwall OS and the content is all paid content, if u want to watch any content you have to pay for subscription.  build quality is average, sound quality is also average it's just loud not clear.  just go for samsung 4010 or higher version, like 4100.  No prime video support. don't fall for useless features."
105,1,Did not meet expectations,"It was again a bad experience with flipkart, as i stopped shoping on flipkart but for some reason i ordered this product from flipkart. I have trust on MI and yes it has fulfilled my all requirement, happy with the product but technician from jeeves associated with flipkart who came to installed this product was very arrogant. He treated me like i got this tv without paying any money. He didnt installed the tv properly, i asked another private technician to do this and paid some amount.i had panel to hang tv on my tv unit but Very badly he convinced me to buy their panel to hang tv, and he was scaring me to go for extended warranty, He literally showed me some videos having issues with Mi tv though i trust Mi i simply ignored him. Its very bad to screwed the name of any reputed and international brand and flipkart is doing this. Flipkart should work to overcome this problem, do teach them how to react with customers, how to have conversation with customers.  I hope no one should face this problem."
106,1,Don't waste your money,Installation team in very wost they did not give a correct update and waste of time they did not follow the time keep up and also the customer service is very very wost in my life i did not saw this type of wost customer service .....totally wast of time

He did not even take some time to explain the features. The users are elderly people who do not have necessary knowledge. Absolutely pathetic installation. The people who are sent for installation need to have some sensitivity about who they are serving to.

307,1,Display Complaint - Panel Issue,"Bought the item in October 2019, Now lines and shade had cropped up on display. Contacted service who visited onsite and took the picture and details, but no updates even after one and half weeks. Imagine spending a premium over other budget tvs of same size and similar specifications and then having to watch it with a damaged display even before the completion of one year. I was, at the first point skeptical about Mi TV after reading lot of complaints and reviews about the panel issue that crops up in many of Mi tvs. But decided to take the risk. But now i feel I should have gone for other options while spending so much considering the cost for peace of mind and long term quality. I would suggest anyone who is reading this to definitely skip this product and look for other options."
308,1,Very poor,Please don't buy any tv or complete protection from flipkart. They provide horrible service . I bought complete protection for 3 years . It's about 20 days I'm complaining about defect in tv but there is no sign of any progress in claim. Save your money it's not worth buying.

627,1,Useless Exchange Policy. Do not fall for lucrative offer,"This is not a product review, have no issues with it. Flipkart not allowing me to review at the Samsung F22 page which got delivered today. Flipkart delivery time period as always is above par. However I am terribly DISAPPOINTED with their exchange policy. I bought Samsung F22 for exchange of my existing Asus Zenphone Max Pro 1 and the exchange value shown was Rs 3800.00 subject to minimum working conditions. When the delivery guy came, he checked all the parameters and it was found up to the mark but as if to find some faults deliberately, he showed me a tiny spot in the screen which I also did not notice as I am using this phone with no issues. In fact, I was to do a factory reset only after the new phone arrives as it is currently my working phone. There are 2 ways to look at it . Either the delivery guy has clear directions of not paying the entire agreed cost of exchange as it appeared to be pre-decided OR the second reason is he has no idea of what is checking. This is even dangerous as the reputation of mighty Company like Flipkart is in hands of such guys. I have never ever posted any negative reviews but I feel cheated and disappointed this time. I did read reviews that Flipkart has very poor exchange policy but did not believe and went ahead as my experience about buying new product is totally different. In the end I paid heavy price for blind trust. Lessons learnt. For all guys out there, if you want to buy a new phone with no exchange go ahead but DO NOT fall into the lucrative exchange prices. Does Flipkart expect us to exchange brand new phone with absolutely no minor scratches or issues? Wish they had better insight and had option of judgement of the exchange product by some expert than some pretty ordinary guy."

Exactly after a year, suddenly displayed the MI logo with the black screen during watching a tv channel, after that no clue what is the exact issue. Tried switching off and ON nothing worked. So initiated the hardest part of contacting MI customer care since I have 2 years extended warranty.  They collected all the details and then requested me to send product invoice and warrenty documents. I sent but afterwards nobody contacted me from MI.  I followed them for every 3 days, all customer care people asked the same questions and had same conversations but nothing done since three weeks.  No way to resolve the issue even I have proper documents and patiently waiting for.  Still the issue is not resolved... Worst Jeeves service but still flipkart supporting them..

1072,1,Unsatisfactory,"My exchange was rejected because they didn't think it was a TV, they thought I was trying to exchange a 24 inch desktop monitor even though I showed them the connection point for a DTH cable. It was just ""too old"" for them. It wasn't the case, first, and second it's no where mentioned that the exchange product has to bought within a certain duration. They weren't able to find out anything then finally, a ray of hope shone on them and they ""found"" a scratch and finally said no to the exchange.. One advice - do not buy anything on exchange from flipkart, actually, do not buy anything from flipkart. Their products are bad and what's worse is the response you get when the product faces any challenge irrespective of the product being in warranty or not.  And the TV is bad. There's a reason why Sony TVs are costly here. I think we need to respect that and stop looking for cheaper options because the compromise they make on the quality is inexcusable! Cannot wait for the EMI of this product to get over so that I can exchange this on Amazon.in!"

It had screen bleeding (White colour appears on dim colour screens ) at all the 4 corners (Perfectly visible while taking In build options- app manager, Gallery, Videos etc). It was replaced within 10 days replacement warranty. The new one arrived today with the same problem. So I think this entire batch (Mi 43"" tv) got this problem, at least this latest batch with latest manufacturing date of mine.  Other issue is that common people will notice & complain it when this screen bleeding or whitish appearance turns to lines on the screen.  hope manufacturers will see to it & rectify it."

5,2,Moderate,Flipkart delivery service is on time but Mi service centre till date tv not installed & wall mounting at my home. Almost 15 days cross but not single call from Mi service centre.. Very poor service by Mi.. Kindly do the needful on priority
6,2,Bad quality,Installation team unnecessarily sold voltage stabilizer stating your tv will not work more than three months without it. No response from flipkart on complaint raised.
7,2,Not good,Chromecast not working
8,2,Not good,first time TV remote not working.... apps opening so late.... sound quality is very good... picture quality is not bad... so then you think.... then product in Buy it

It automatically gets switched off after 4 to 5 hours of continuous usage 2. Remote is not user friendly, especially for old age people 3. Two useless buttons on remote for ""Prime Video"" and ""Netflix""... what should I do with them if I dont have their premium subscription? 4. Does not support plug and play USB gamepad 5. Sound quality can be improved"
81,2,Not good,Delicate screen..my 2yr old son punched and screen the shattered ..
82,2,Majorly Buggy,"At first blush, it seems like you get a lot for the money. However, its got a lot of bugs which detracts from the entire viewing experience and ultimately mars it down as a product. First off, the HDR performance is terrible. It is an HDR TV only for namesake. Second, there are 4 horizontal lines visible on the panel whenever it is displaying solid colours. the lines are very faint but noticeable and once you seem them, its difficult to unsee and becomes a constant irritant. Third off, the backlight is erratic as the top half refuses to switch on and requires multiple restarts of the TV set before it starts working."
83,2,Could be way better,Poor connectivity....
84,2,Bad quality,No installation after 3 days
85,2,Expected a better product,Its tooo...bad..complaint..full if damage piece...and no service..it is seconened..ite..dont buy this frdss

99,2,Bad quality,Installation company Jeeves is horrible. Do not make a mistake of buying the extended warranty. You have to make multiple calls to them just for installation and never show up as per schedule. Flipkart is terrible with after sales on electronics. They're okay for clothing and footwear.

125,2,Could be way better,"The cast screen ,and app download is not working this tv isnot small tv at all"
126,2,Slightly disappointed,Not worth of money
127,2,Moderate,darkness on below side
128,2,Bad quality,Screen mirroring not connected showing error
129,2,Could be way better,No more effect as MI shows features
130,2,Slightly disappointed,awesome picture clarity
131,2,Not good,Issue with Internet connectivity... repeatedly asks for connection
132,2,Expected a better product,"Picture & Sound quality is OK for the price. Major problem is with the connectivity ...WiFi is not getting connected automatically, Everytime we need to go into settings to connect WiFi, then there is disconnection issues in Chromecast. Major problem is with HDMI connectivity, if you planning to connect your home theater thru HDMI ARC, please think twice, please go thru mi forums, most users are facing ARC connectivity issue, there is no proper fix provided by MI yet."
133,2,Moderate,very very very very bad experience mirroring screen is not working when u connect mobile with tv with data cable it's not working

143,2,Could be way better,Do not but this tv. There is lots of connectivity issues.
144,2,Not good,sound quality is very very poor
145,2,Moderate,it consumes hell lot of internet. there is proper option to select video quality. extra buttons are of no use.
146,2,Moderate,some fiture is not working
147,2,Slightly disappointed,Flipkart not response properly. return policy given by flipkart but 3 - 4 times canceled by flipkart team. HD quality is not good.
148,2,Not good,Good picture quality but system lags a lot. it hangs for each application.
149,2,Could be way better,best android tv in this price
150,2,Not good,One word review is : Disappointing First Sound Output is too low Second All Mi Tv have Chromecast But u can only cast when u have active Internet Connection means ur All data goes through online whether its downloaded or not if u have a movie to cast u need 1GB+ Data just to cast   Picture Quality is good but it too much lag while Tv start sometimes we have to shut it off then start again
151,2,Could be way better,delivery is on time and delivery boy is very sincere
152,3,Nice,Very Simple 2 Points noted for this Smart TV. 1-Google Chromecast not properly working on this TV. No screen mirroring support going Hanged if you try to do this. This 2 feature not working in this TV.  2- All other thing are best in TV .  So if you want using Google Chromecast and Screen mirror DO NOT BUT THIS TV AT ANY COST.
153,3,Does the job,The TV in overall package is really great however the modem that is inbuilt for WIFI connection to be established is not upto the expectation which results in the content being buffered on the TV despite other devices work well with the WIFI connection and show great speeds on them as well. The only thing that i am not happy about is Flipkart itself for the delivery being so slow and unpredictable. TV is great for now until i plan for a big one..lol..
154,3,Good,"Overall viewing quality of the TV is good. Connectivity to third party apps are smooth and works. However, I find a lag when you watch sports channels and find a ghost like image when the balls (football or tennis ball) pass. It is advisable to keep cleaning the memory and storable if you want optimal performance. I would have liked to have more picture control options..."
155,3,Good,"THE 3 YEAR COMPLETE PROTECTION PLAN IS A SCAM!!!! I REPEAT.. ITS A SCAM.. The TV is nice, but better go for Mi extended warranty. JEEVES POLICY IS A SCAM!! LOOK IT UP IF YOU DON'T TRUST ME."
156,3,Fair,"sound quality was not managed properly when ever the action sequences comes speaker sound raise automatically too loud it's too irretating  Bluetooth available but it won't connect external device like our Android mobile, wireless bluetooth headset etc  after the 9 pie update screen mirroring not working  but another wise picture quality was too good at this price range"
157,3,Just okay,"Everything is fine about product, but my msg is regarding installation. The guy provided us to be installed the led he somehow manage to make a call to us and said that the installation to be done on 30sep,2021, perhaphs we got led on 17sep,2021 and it is already fixed that led can be installed the next day which is 18sep,2021. Which the thing i don't like, we are not idiots that we got product and wait for 12 to 13 days isn't worth it?secondly their feedback time is very poor they donot going to recieve our calls which is not so good. Its my request to flipcart team or to retailer that pls provide customer those persons which are to things on time which is already fixed and last but not least recieve calls. Regards"
158,3,Good,"Sound is disappointing and so is the Wi-Fi connectivity. The Wi-Fi keeps getting disconnecting frequently so TV keeps switching between being smart and dumb. Any application is of no use until the Wi-Fi is stable. And to clarify, the issue doesn't lie with the router. Other devices work perfectly from the same spot and even further. BTW the picure quality is good so when it works, watching is a charm"
159,3,Does the job,1. Speaker quality is poor. Not much clarity in audio output 2. TV table stand holders are mere cheap plastic. Not durable 3. Wireless connectivity like screen mirror doesn't work smooth. Disconnects sometime. But not a big problem. 4. At start up it takes about nearly 60 seconds for switching on display. 5. Picture quality is good
160,3,Fair,Picture quality is good but not great the black levels are bad...because its an LG ips panel...if you watch a movie from side ways you can hardly see anything..specially night scenes its totally white...and strange there is no colour setting. plus the refresh rate is only 60hz which makes fast moving shots look really bad...sound is ok.....Tv looks very elegant.... overall TV is good if you dont care of black levels..Netflix and prime plays good on it.
161,3,Does the job,This is a budget 4k tv and it shows. I previously owned a 2013 model 49 inch LG led tv for 8 years till now. My cousin has just bought a 2020 model 65 inch LG led tv and my best friend has a 2021 model . When i compare MI tv to those the difference is apparent. THE BIGGEST PROBLEM IS BRIGHTNESS. after watching LG and Samsung tvs for so long this tv just feels cheap. Even my 80 year old grandma asked why this tv had such low brightness screen. The picture modes on this tv sucks. Only one worth watching in is vivid all other bring some strange tinges to the screen. Also sometimes the software is just awful. SO IF YOU HAD SAMSUNG OR LG TV'S GO AND BUY THE SAME BRAND OTHERWISE YOU'LL SURELY NOTICE THE DIFFERENCE.  NB: NOTICE THE ORANGE TINT IN MOVIE MODE
162,3,Nice,"Excellent customer service from Flipkart. The television is really worth for the price i paid. But The drawbacks are as follows - slow start and connectivity (takes over 15-40 secs for the software to load) - wifi connectivity is moderate - specific apps malfunction often (youtube,vlc,mxplayer,etc) - just 2GB ram (definitely not helping and the ROOT CAUSE FOR ALL SLOWNESS) - IF there is a way to extend RAM then all my issues would be solved   PROS - - The picture quality is really good. Even though its not as fluidic as major televisions, this tv is far better than 40k samsung and sony televisions - Well Size matters (43inch was a bang)"
163,3,Fair,Review after 1month of use.. picture quality is good. sound is avg.. but connectivity is horrible... wifi is working well but it is not supporting chromecast now... in early days cromecast was doing good bt now it is not even showing it
164,3,Decent product,Tv is bit slow to start. There is no mute button in the remote and everytime we have to switch to hdmi for channels in set-up box moreover everytime we have to press power button in tv remote to start .Picture quality doesn't seems like 4k. Better to go for a normal hd tv in companies like sony and samsung. overall if you want to experience a high class picture and sound quality i don't recommend this. If you are not particular about quality and for temporary usage it will be a decent option.
165,3,Decent product,what else can you expect in a budget of 25k ok ok product if you want quality picture and sound and in past if you have used tv like sony and Samsung it no where match the quality of picture and sound it's like tata nano ab seven seeter
166,3,Fair,I bought it when it was newly launched on October 4th 2019. There are some bugs need to be fixed. As I know the major issue I faced is When any Bluetooth speaker or headphones is connected then videos aren't loading in prime video and Netflix
167,3,Does the job,"ok good , only screen monitoring is very disappointed sometimes structking and automatically disconnecting installation worriest never seen this type installation"
168,3,Does the job,"No Result In Sound, Picture Quality & Screen Mirroring In Problem-Mobile connect To Tv Problem."
169,3,Just okay,Internet connectivity issue most of the time Screen mirroring issue never solved Unable to power on without remote/power button
170,3,Just okay,"The rest of the things in this TV are good but the main issue here are the connectivity issues. It takes a long time while connecting to Wifi and that is also not a guarantee that it will stay connected. For a smart TV, connectivity issues are a nightmare. Once you start watching a movie, it is really frustrating that wifi keeps disconnecting multiple times throughout your experience."
171,3,Decent product,TV is very good but but there is installation problem its been a day no one came to install so kindle check the issues
172,3,Decent product,"screen mirroring is not working, wifi connectivity is very slow. don't buy this tv. i am fully disappointed. Vu tv better than mi tv."
173,3,Does the job,"Reviewing after 1 and half year display and sound quality is excellent but the display is weak just a small pressure can break the display , so overall viewing quality is very good but build quality of display is sooooo bad.... So use it carefully and also if the display break by you it not covers in warranty ..."
174,3,Decent product,Product is really good and best in market however Serive of Jeeves is really poor. Very unprofessional instaltion and very bad experice of intalation for 3rd time by Jeeves. Flipkart should look towards it regarding such unaccepted services.
175,3,Just okay,Sound is worst
176,3,Does the job,"Make sure you have Wifi router close to this TV Or else you will struggle alot. The connectivity reception of MI tv is very poor. I did had a realme tv and the wifi router was placed at the same place where it is currently, but realme tv never had any issues in wifi range. Realme tv was streaming perfectly fine and I changed it to Mi tv and all sorts of connectivity issues started. I have 40mbps speed still Mi tv was having streaming problem due to wifi range issue. Now I had to buy a wifi repeater to get my Mi tv some wifi to stream seamlessly. After installing repeater all is fine. The sound and picture quality is great. No complains. Overall good buy if you have wifi router very near to your tv otherwise be ready to spend some extra bucks for repeaters or change of position of your routers."
177,3,Decent product,Everything is good but should have had 16gb storage
178,3,Nice,"Voice clarity is low. Music is in High level, voice in low level. Acceptable for budget tv."
179,3,Just okay,Facing tv start problem after 18month of use
180,3,OK OK product but we can do better.,"dont go with what is marketed. 4K output is really bad. hotstar videos are really dull as they are in 4K. speakers are highly untuned. imagine living with parents and enabling subtitles to watch a video as the sudden loudness will be extremely rude. HDR10+ and nits per square inch, should be considered before buying. hence more the cost better the TV."
181,3,Nice,"Cast option is not working, many errors for connection, wifi is getting on and off"
182,3,Fair,Sound was not that good.
183,3,Fair,TV picture quality is good. But sound quality is not good. Very low sound of TV.
184,3,Just okay,All gud except WiFi connectivity... extremely poor connectivity evn on fastest broadband wifi.
185,3,FLIPKART's flawed EMI system!,"TV is GOOD! Flipkart's system is flawed, it doesn't detect EMI when selected during Checkout! And you have to go and activate it from the Banks end and you end up paying more!"
186,3,Just okay,"In the first order I think I have received defect piece, it was not connecting to WiFi.  I requested for replacement. It's been 25 days after replacement, this one looks good."
187,3,Fair,"Hello all,  Writting this review after using this tv for 1 month.  TV picture quality is good. decent sounds however it should be little high compare to price.  the biggest con is its build in casting and network drive its very poor  I have read review of others who is saying they are not facing , even I did not face initial days but while casting my son has shutdown the tv from then I am not able to find the device ..  reset my tv twise"
188,3,Fair,Avarage
189,3,Nice,Nice
190,3,Does the job,Nice tv with great quality picture..overall it's good package..
191,3,Fair,After selecting any mode for example sound mode the screen goes back. We have to again select sound mode which causes problem. Hope this will be fixed. There is some lag in the tv. Wifi disconnects sometimes. Sometimes apps say not connected to internet despite wifi showing connected( we have to reboot the tv to overcome the problem).
192,3,Nice,Extremely poor sound... Need more sound clarity ... But picture quality is nice...
193,3,Just okay,"After using 21 months I'm writing this review. There is no doubt it's a amazing product. But now it's shown it's built quality. My TV now stopped working, got issue with it's panel. Picture is not coming out. Mi service technician has said that they have put order for panel and I have to wait for atleast 10 days. After spending 55k if you didn't get a quality product, it will be a annoying factor. End of the day you will definately get a feel that you are using a Chinese product."
194,3,Just okay,"Sound is not good as much i expected. And chrom cast is not working properly literally not working, once it showed ur first screen in ur phone then nothing.No movements. And also i tested 4K video from a usb. It's not that smooth, it's laggy. Which i shooted on ma mobile.loading of apps such as YouTube and stuffs are slow. Once u enter then its fine I didn't hit wifi issue"
195,3,Does the job,Go for Vu they are much better than mi
196,3,Decent product,Every few seconds it stutters when channel is on HD.
197,3,Good,Not as expected. Does not give the feel of Ultra or 4K HD Quality. DTS/Dolby not effective. Not worth the money. Worst ever WiFi connectivity. 2 GB RAM works like 0.5 GB RAM.  Please let me know if I could return the product.
198,3,Just okay,"product is excellent but installation company jeeves gives rubbish customer services , installation not done on tym ,very bad ecperience regarding installation."
199,3,Decent product,"TV is not supporting sony home theatre system. TV don't has inbuilt stabilizer, it will cost around 2.5 to 3K more, they don't provide free wall mount. For extra 2yrs warranty, we need to spend some 2K more. All together it will come near to 30K."
200,3,Good,"connectivity problem, screen mirroring is not working properly."

218,3,Nice,"The picture quality of the TV is good and even numerous SD channels come up very well on the TV, however the blacks appear grey.  As per company, the TV should not be run for more than 3 hours at a stretch. This is a serious issue and is going to significantly shorten the life. The installation experience was very poor."
219,3,Decent product,TV is good but problem is you can not install other app from play store. Even you can not install google chrome browser. I don't know why they did like this. Disappointed
220,3,Does the job,Product received on time but installation team not worked properly.. They have no idea remote has to pair with tv then it will work.. Installation team said it's not working we will send you new remote..after that no response from them we are calling and they are just giving different numbers and everyone is just ignoring us...one month TV not in use.... .then we are submitted complaint in Flipkart customer care...after that in 10 days one more service man came and pair this remote with tv and it starts... Flipkart Need to appoint intelligent and cooperative team....Now tv is working but little bit slow response. Ok ok product.
221,3,Fair,"I have been using this TV model from last 6-7 months, TV got slow even I haven't installed any app from app store. Often TV doesn't detect internet connection instead of showing connected in Network Settings, then I need clear memory and running process through TV manager( standard application provided with all MI devices) or I need to restart if issue still persists. TV resolution often gets Frozen for a while and doesn't even respond to remote button press. Spoke to support and they asked me to reset the device which will wipe all login credentials !! Ahh that's a great solution. Apart from that TV sound sucks, as we already know it's a 20 watts speaker but no sign of Dolby digital as mentioned on TV box or flipkart website. Not sure if remote have issues as it stops responding when we press button in front or from different side (as it's an Bluetooth remote)."
222,3,Nice,it's been 2 month i have this t.v. .. overall value for money. but facing issue of screen quality..screen is blinking and leaves color for a seconds while watching.now it's irritating.. MI if you are seeing this review get this one sorted out.

280,3,Just okay,"Tv features and qualities are good but the remote is not attractive,it looks like a simple remote not a smart one.Tv oprates only by remote if your remote will be lost or damaged then your TV will become only a showpiece .

355,3,Decent product,Good in price range
356,3,Color depth is pathtic look for samsung TV they are better,"Color depth is pathetic, i really don't enjoy the picture quality, please go for any Samsung TV they will be great.

357,3,Good,Super
358,3,Does the job,I didn't see any difference between 4k and FHD. You can see same quality in MI 4A pro. HDMI cable is short. Installation guys are install setup box holder stand is too small.

367,3,Good,Picture quality is very good. Sound will only be good if you have downloaded 4k videos. While streaming on Netflix the sound quality drops. Sometimes the wifi doesn't get connected fast. That may be because of my slow internet. Overall nothing major to complain for a product under 24k. Excellent value for money.

414,3,Just okay,"Everything is good but, Three cons are there. 1. Wifi connectivity : it sometimes doesn't work i.e even if we connect an wifi network it says no internet and stops working. 2. Sound : only music audio is good & while coming to speech audio its very low. it lacks a balance between both audios. It should come with an proper equaliser. 3. Google assistant : it doesn't even work. It doesn't even recognise your voice properly. Should optimize it thorough next updates."
415,3,Fair,some one good
416,3,Nice,Product is over all gud but the response of the customer care of Flipkart is very poor.

432,3,Nice,"3 stars because of poor installation. Firstly the installation guy was intentionally trying to sell his company's TV stand although we denied him first. Later he fixed the TV on the wall on an angle which was supposed to be correctly horizontal. Pathetic TV setup service.  Coming on to TV, it is a top product at this price. Picture quality is amazing and sound seems wow ♥. Do not mind the negative reviews, You guys can go for it."
433,3,Nice,Tv was good in this price but sound quality is medium delivery is average but installation is not good they charged me 500 for wall Mount but wall Mount from other local company

441,3,Decent product,"I was going to buy a Vu smart tv but ended up buying MI as Vu TV's were out of stock on all the ecommerce websites. Now let's talk about the Mi TV. It's good for the price. The connectivity of this TV is not that great. Sound is ok for me but it's not perfect. I could have bought TV's from other brands like Motorola, Kodak, Shinco, Nokia, Hisense and others but I preferred Mi over others due to there strong presence in market."
442,3,Fair,Veri good product
443,3,The Hard Truth!,"Well, if you just want to watch TV then go for it, otherwise please stay with me!  1. That WiFi disconnection problem is still exists. It's rare but it's there. For a smooth experiance, I will suggest to use ethernet if your parents uses the TV.  2. Viewing angle is very poor. I mean you can see everything from a wider angle but the colors will fade after 25-30' angle.  3. Well the Fake HDR10. I tried Netflix and some PS4 games over this TV everything looks muddy and scattered. Compared to any HDR10 monitor / TVs like Sony or Samsung. Like the diff is hell n haven. The most important thing is to use HDR you need some serious digging for this TV. You need to turn on HDMI2.0 to use HDR from external devices and this option is not under the regular settings. After switching to your desired HDMI port you need to long press the select button on your TV remote and its there under display settings.  4. Bluetooth disconnection is a problem too. If you connect a bluetooth speaker / soundbar the TV occasionally switches its sound output to inbuilt speakers and you can't switch it back to your bluetooth device cuz there is no option to connect/select. You need to unpair and re-pair your device to use it again. Sometimes restarting the TV also solves the problem.  5. Also if you connect a bluetooth audio device you can't play HDR content from the apps. It switches to SDR.  6. You may like it but personally hate Patchwall. Its unnecessary and complicate things for my parents.  After all this I still want to give it a 3 star cuz the price of this TV is very low, otherwise it's a 2 star TV. I bought it for my home but I would never buy it again for my personal use."
444,3,Just okay,"Picture quality is not good , found very difference as 4k ultra HD as the resolution is not up to the mark, I bought it for 4k ultra Hd smart tv having 3840 picture resolution, but got very poor resolution as compared to other company 4k smart tv. So I would not suggest for buying it ."
445,3,Good,Installation man charged for wall mount 499
446,3,Fair,"Very much irritated because of the mi ad, it always appears blocking the cable control options They said after 1 month it will go after update, still not gone after 1 month.  It's really irritating, is mi software developer are stupids, someone should file defame case against mi for this stupidity for using others property for free advertising"
447,3,Decent product,"Value for money product.But installation person installed a ordinary mount which roughly would cost 200 (Not MI Brand,local mount) but charged 500 as per flipkart rate.Wifi got connected easily but casting isn't working at all."

454,3,Just okay,"I purchased Mi 4x 108 cm (43) Ultra HD (4K,) LED Smart Android TV from flip kart a few months back. Delivery is ok. But one thing upsets me very much. This TV doesn't allow to watch YouTube in 4K resolution. Its maximum resolution is FHD (1080p). This negativity has not been exposed anywhere. This is a TRUE PROBLEM in this TV. Otherwise, this product is ' VALUE FOR MONEY '."
455,3,Decent product,Sound quality is not good
456,3,Fair,The technician made many scratches on screen while installing.... Disgusting.. His fingerprints are easily visible on screen and screen has been scratched by wall mount screw by him...

487,3,Decent product,I have used it for a week now and as the previous comments I have read it has severe connectivity issue with wifi. It shows that it is connected but gets disconnected. Only buy this product if u wish to use it using a eathernet cable. There are a few glitches too but that's fine. Patchwall is great and the new update for that is also good.
488,3,Just okay,Major issues is connectivity
489,3,Nice,Really love it ...so easy to use ...🤩
490,3,Good,"Don't expect more while seeing specifications and reviews, i am pretty satisfied and mi want to improve more in connectivity with a software update, if you have a standard wi-fi network it's okay, picture quality is above average and sound quality is below average when you were wall mounted the tv speaker is placed in the back panel so echo effect is there, viewing angeles were good and finally service network was superb and punctual 😊"

503,3,Decent product,It's worth buy. But disappointed with flipkart delivery and installation service. Delivery was scheduled on 17th August and order was reached to nearest hub on 15th August. However delivery I got delivery on 19th August. Without any reason the order delayed by 2 days. Also t installation was scheduled on 19th August itself but same thing happened. Installation postponed to 20th August. I got sms in morning for installation with contact number of service engineer. When I tried to reach him there was no response. After some time he call me back and said that he will come at 3pm but he didn't come even after 5pm so I called customer care and then they have managed to do installation at 9pm today. But the guy was very rude and in hurry. He left without full demo and my TATA Sky was not working due to poor Singal so he took 200 rupees extra for just touching dish antenna. This is worst experience with flipkart after sales service.
504,3,Fair,"User friendly delivery. Sound Quality is not as expected. MI should update the OS appropriately to solve some ChromeCast, Mirroring, connectivity problems."
505,3,Good,sound quality is average

509,3,Nice,connectivity is not proper
510,3,Just okay,There is a bug in the tv. Hdmi arc connectivity has issue. First time when you turn on the tv it won't detect automatically. You need to restart the tv in order to use the Arc. This becomes a problem if you are connecting to sound bar. This donesnot have optical out. So you need to rely on arc port for hd out sound. I have raised a complaint and technicians cannot solve and waiting for a software update. It's been 2 months and till yet no update came.  Customer support is good. Technician will come within 2 to 3 days.  Overall good for this price. But things are lacking. HD videos are ok only. Screen brightens is less. Patch wall feature is good. Remote is very handy. Noise reduction is not that good. Blacks are not that good too. Good for watching HD or 4K videos only. Sound is ok. There is no lag.
511,3,Nice,"I don't know what is coming out side of screen,and why the given qr code on scree it is not removed,and updated is very slow,and sound aslo delay in home theatre video quality is good"

Can anyone confirm if any app detects display resolution as 2160p ?"
682,3,Nice,Sound quality should improve
683,3,Does the job,"over all value for money but sound quality is not as expected,booting time is also very high any satisfied for paid."
684,3,"Budget large screen 4k smart tv, value for money",speaker sound isn't good. could've been better
685,3,Nice,av port of this device is not working. hence i couldn't connect set top box. now connected through HDMI port. also the device is hanging in between I expected more fluidity
686,3,Fair,"don't buy this product, picture quality is like HD ready tv and sound like old tv."
687,3,Good,good
688,3,Fair,sound is very low
689,3,Good,Not much better it's ok....

692,3,Nice,MI TV is not good this product is average
693,3,Fair,satisfied with the product....value for money. 4k panel is osm.....
694,3,Nice,I thought the picture quality would be better but its like another full hd tv. I cannot diffrentiate between full HD and 4K
695,3,Does the job,can't switch off the tv with remote...wht should I do?
696,3,Just okay,GOOD TV BUT USB PORT IS NOT REACHABLE WHEN WALL MOUNTED
697,3,Good,Although the product is great value for money based on a week review but here are few cons that needs to be considered while purchasing dis Mi 4X LED TV.  1. Takes time to boot up. 2. Lag in mirror casting 3. Average sound quality.
698,3,Nice,picture quality good design not so good good product in this price range
699,3,Does the job,"While the product is quite good for the price, patchwall crashes too often. Sound again is not loud. Hopefully some software updates should do the trick"
700,3,Good,wall mount chargers are too high. Company like mi must give this thing free with mi brand on it.
701,3,Does the job,Right product according price
702,3,Decent product,"very good picture quality at this price point , but I can't able to update my new mobile number in app thank you Flipkart, but connectivity is so poor"
703,3,Just okay,"Picture & Sound quality OK, SD Channels quality poor, must viewed HD Channels and high speed internet connection is required. dispointed with remote up button pressing hardly. FINALLY VERY GOOD."
704,3,Just okay,there is no data saver option in this TV and always connecting to wifi for screen cast. it's a waste of time.
705,3,Good,good
706,3,Nice,"Average built quality, need compulsory HD channel connection if u need to enjoy 4k, if u efforts, go to sony"
707,3,Nice,Decent Device. Sound is average should have been louder and better. Display is decent. SD Content looks pixelated but HD & 4K looks decent. Sometimes the device hangs up.  Audio - 2.5/5 Video - 3.5/5 Value for Money - 3.5/5
708,3,Nice,Good
709,3,Just okay,it's good picture was good
710,3,Fair,just avaraje
711,3,Nice,Loads of interstitial full-screen Ads on TV. Not all side loaded apps are viewable in apps tab. Limited apps in Google Play. Cannot connect mobile phone with USB cable
712,3,Good,"Video clarity 4K is awesome, SD videos could be much better. Sound quality is above average. connectivity is not upto the mark"
713,3,Just okay,audio is horrible rest is great as per the price
714,3,Decent product,Ok For the price
715,3,Decent product,"ok not bad. sound, pic quality and connectivity is good. let us see in future."
716,3,Nice,HDMI cable not working in new xstrem airtel box
717,3,Does the job,Very good service... Nice boy... DEBABRATA GIRI
718,3,Nice,"Product is good, but flipkart service partner jeeves is very unprofessional and irresponsible"
719,3,Good,TV IS GOOD BUT POOR INSTALLATION.
720,3,Fair,Awesome picture image and sound quality.... But connectivity is a big issue... Value for money.
721,3,Decent product,poor sound clarity
722,3,Nice,Audio quality of this TV is worse than the CRT.
723,3,NOT EXCELLENT BUT GOOD,TV IS GOOD. PICTURE QUALITY AND SOUND QUALITY IS OK BUT WORTH TO BUY THIS PRODUCT.
724,4,Very Good,"PROs 1) great picture quality for this price. 2) it supports almost all formats. 3) sound is good. 4) borders are thin, design is simply elegant. even logo is not irritating eyes. 5) User Interface is simpler because of android. 6) Patchwall 2.0 is quite useful after some use. 7) connectivity to internet and phone is simple and reliable. 8) Powercable is long enough and of good quality. 9) Voice operations are more accurate than before. 10) More Settings and many Modes for pictures are given. 98% value for money.. 😎 just buy it and experience yourself.  CONs: 1) I could give 5 stars if all slots like usb, hdmi etc given near to the edge.. they all are given in center. so if you are wall mounting it, its difficult and unsafe to reach there. (you can use usb extender) 2) When you are using internet, like YouTube or anything else and if your connection is disconnected in middle of usage, TV will hang. sometimes it is only option to Poweroff it. 3) It is very big and thin in size. it is good, but if you have children then it is unsafe to keep it on table mount. 4) Remote Doesn't come with rechargable inbuilt battery like One plus remote, it requires AAA batteries. 5) Remote is lightweight, but not feels like premium and for rough usage. 6) though it is advisable to use wall mount for this tv, cleaning in backside is headache after some time. 7) if you are using set top box, and your speakers are connected to set top box, than the sound and pictures on tv compared to sound of speaker may be lagging. 8) starting time is little long.  These all CONs can be ignored because of its low price and good quality, but company can fix it easily."
725,4,Pretty good,"Great picture quality at affordable price, sound quality is an outlier in otherwise perfect product.  I'm really impressed with the specifications and price. tested and amazed with picture quality as well. interface is smooth and easy to hands-on.  app references are given but you have to download all of them as you wish.  cons: one and only disappointment. Sound. .sound quality is below par . equalisation definitely has some issue, you need to have remote in hand all the time to control ever changing high and low dBs from dialogues to songs in movie/series. .sound clarity is okayish.  #Cant ask for a better product at such price range.  hope a patch will come for the sound asap."
726,4,Good choice,"Its a great bang for buck TV.  Pros: -- 4K panel is great. You can clearly notice difference between full HD and 4K when you're closer or using it as a monitor.  -- Performance is good enough. Better than Firestick in many instances. Worse in case of prime video (which is expected). Startup takes about 30 seconds which is fine for a smart TV.   -- Ability to use default android TV interface instead of MI skin  -- Decent set of ports. Glad it also includes a 3.5mm headphone port which many TV ignore these days.  -- Lightweight and slim remote  ********** Cons -- Desperately needs sound leveling. Action scenes in movies and dialogues have a huge difference in db levels.  -- Stand is made of plastic not metal  -- Remote should have a mute button  -- Package didn't include 2 AAA cells for the remote, but what the heck its just nitpicking.  Its a great TV. Buy it if you're looking for a good TV at a very cheap price. Do not buy older MI 4A or 4X pro because it just has 1GB RAM which will not provide decent performance. Go with MI 4X only."
727,4,Pretty good,"Good Value for Money. writing this review after 10 days of purchase. Picture Quality: Picture quality and 4K experience is really good and I had a slight concern when I read the customer reviews before purchase.. but now, I don't feel that as bad and I recommend this as best one in this budget.  Sound Quality: You will be amazed when you hear the output from this.!! Yes, Output is too Clear and Crystal. You don't need a sound-bar from this. It supports different format and FLAC one throws the best 👌  Connectivity & Apps: Here comes the major part which fulfills the SMART TV. I was in oscillation with Vu Android Premium 4K SMART Tv(No Amazon Prime access) by reading the reviews. Still not convinced with service / service centers by Vu. Yes, connectivity issues are there with Bluetooth remote. Twice it got disconnected and couldn't turn on the TV. luckily, I had a Mi Mobile to turn on the Device and re-paired the remote. No flaws in WiFi connectivity and with other ports. works perfectly. mobile Hotspot doesn't stream 4K videos. You need more patience in using Apps as it takes time to load and each time when you switch on the TV. Since it has Low RAM, this cannot be rectified., I have not installed any other app to experience it. may be Mi can fix other connectivity issues thru Software Update. still I'm not satisfied in this area.  Delivery & Installation: **5Star** Flipkart does this best which takes away the users from other sites.  Verdict: Perfect Package at this budget with all features. Good Picture Quality (best with Vivid mode) & True Sound.  Cons: You may feel insecure and low trust because of connectivity issues reported.  Suggestions: I recommend to go with this TV additionally with 3 years extended warranty. wen compared to other competitors Mi has more service centers. check all the connectivities within 10 days of purchase especially with Remote, WiFi, YouTube streaming.  Hope this review will help little bit in taking decisions."
728,4,Really Nice,worth buying this tv to watch 4k content. I see beautiful images. delivery was fast and installation was fast. call the service center directly for quick installation . for sound i will give 3/5 sound is not that good its ok.
729,4,Really Nice,"Its my 1st smart TV. I am very much satisfied with picture quality, sound etc. Engineer visited same day for installation & given demo in brief. phone casting is not so smooth, it lacks for 1 second multiple times. Tried installing Jio TV but not worked so far. Except it, all well. Overall, good product in this range."
730,4,Value-for-money,picture quality is excellent in this price range .. sound is loud and clear but bass not upto the mark..and really value for money product from mi. nicely improved TV comparetivly from older ones.
731,4,Wonderful,"first of all this is the best TV at their price range. sound is just awesome with Dolby Atmos, perfect for watching movies. image quality is good not bad. Again there is no much difference with 4k and Ultra Hd. finally here comes to con - connectivity could be even more better."
732,4,Really Nice,"it has been a week I am using the 65""TV. so far it is good. value for money. sound is good but not excellent. after system update the maximum volume level is showing only 50. we have to control the voLume through DTH box remote. I will give more feedback about the TV after using few more days.  TV does not come with wall mount bracket. we have to pay additional charges to installation person. fixed wall mount bracket price is Rs.500.  Jeeves installation is average. the person who comes give an option for fixed wall bracket or Movable wall bracket. I preferred go for movable wall bracket. the actual cost of this is around Rs.1600 online, but he demands for Rs.2700 , if asked for discount he will reduce 100 or 200. In effect you would end up paying Rs.2500. please look outside and keep the bracket ready instead of paying more to the installation person. if we buy our own bracket, The installation person may say the quality of the bracket is not good, because we have not bought from him. Think before you plan."
733,4,Good choice,"Give 4/5 because the remote does not have a MUTE button. else it was 5/5 An Advise to MI , the product company . Stop the flash sale as this will impact your sales , you might think this will create demand of product, you might be wrong, people are not patient as before they will opt for other brands even if its slightly at higher price .  When you have a good product , dispose it to the consumers ASAP , this will create a big impact than flash sale ."
734,4,Very Good,"I ordered this tv in first sale and since then i am using it. The best tv at this price. The tv is good in every aspect. Display quality superb, build quality good and the connectivity is amazing 4k gets easily loaded only the sound is little low. You need to keep the volume level above 40 to hear the sound clear while watching a movie."
735,4,Good quality product,Mi led tv 4x pro is good in sound and picture ..But installation service by Jeeves/flipkart is very poor. My tv delivered on 24 may but installation done on date 29may after some many calls to customer care number..After use of one week amazing performance cast mirroring and so many features...Go for buy
736,4,Wonderful,"The picture quality is fine at this price range. Even the sound quality is good but only sometimes while watching live TV the sound quality somewhat lowers hope to see the changes in the update. The user interface and the built-in patchwall is also good and easy to navigate . Unfortunately, there are no frequent software updates given. Just 2 software updates received with no major changes. Disappointed in that terms."
737,4,Good quality product,"I have purchased 65inch about 10 days back for 55k . I am happy so far that delivery, installation and performance of TV is very good. I could not explore all the features of the tv yet. This TV is value for money as similar TVs with brand name are costing 3 to 6 times of its price. I am not a techno savvy person as I am 60 +, hence my comments on features may not correctly reflect reality. But I feel this tv is a very good buy. Earlier I had purchased VU tv 43 inch from flipkart in 2015, which has worked for more than 4 years without a single problem. I happy with overall service from flipkart and products sold by them"
738,4,Nice product,good product I like mi tv nice value for money but data saver option is not on my tv
739,4,Worth every penny!,"Product is good overall in this budget. I do not see any color bleed and it seems LG panel is making quite an impact on this model. It's real eye candy to watch 4k and full hd is so good to watch on such a huge screen! Sound is enough for drawing room; in fact just enough for normal news and serial watching. If you want to make it a home theater, then Boat Avante 2000 160w is a killer deal and I'm surprised to see that an under 10k sound bar can give such a run for money to costly siblings. However, following features must be addressed by MI in their next OT update for this TV:  1- No quick way to change the sound output. Every time you have to quit watching to access settings, change the output and come back launch the program again 2- Pixel UI sometimes crashes. More testing is needed. I found a way to correct it whenever it conks. Just change the theme from light to dark and vizaviz 3- Data Saver option always resets back to ON after restarting the TV. It's annoying when I have a dedicated broadband line and don't need this feature at all.  I have given extra star only because of the Flipkart delivery system. They are best at handling fragile items. Same day installation was another surprise and the folks were super professional. This shows that brands are now taking Indian market seriously and know that good customer service will go long way."
740,4,Good choice,"A Good Buy.. but not the best.  pros : clear and sharp picture quality, connectivity is good cons : sound is below average , casting lags a little.  I am using tower speakers and it works perfect with bluetooth connection.  overall an OK purchase at this price."
741,4,"Delightful,and the Best in range","Everything is Best. The Delivery, and the installation was done on the day of delivery with in hours which was the best thing happened. The Installation guy was very good with the knowledge about the television. The only con I've observed was the Casting. Casting is not good. Hope it can be solved with proper system update. And also Casting is working only when phone and tv connected to same WiFi which is not happened in other popular brands. Casting connectivity totally cuts that 1 star rating. Overall the picture quality,sound and performance is the best in this price point. I do recommend this TV to who ever wants to buy it."
742,4,Value-for-money,"I had high expectations about the product due to high media hype about it by MI as well as by users. However, the picture quality while using cable channels is greatly disappointing and about, the so called dolby dts sound, the output is very very less and effect is horrible. The quality of sound does not match with the big screen TV. instead of woofer, MI has provided only poor quality of 20 W speakers which are suitable for voice only. Music or film can not be enjoyed with inbuilt speakers while we had enjoyed the great 10 w speakers provided by Sony in 32 inch tv. While playing videos, especially 4K videos, its spectacular and mind blowing. I use extra sound system through, then it is awesome. However, when I think of the amount I paid for the product, I forget all the defects and short comings and simply enjoy the show. No other company can give this product with this much low price. At my home, We four people use MI phones as well. With this product, we have become great fan of MI. thank you MI. With warm regards. Sudhakaran Wadakancheri"
743,4,Very Good,"The MI TV (65"") is really a beast! No other words can be used to describe the experience.. Thanx Xiaomi... Talking about the TV, the picture is superb - full 5 Stars; however the sound is satisfactory, not great but pretty okay.. Other features are also nice, including connecting with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth devices... In short, the Xiaomi MI 4X TV is well worth the price at Rs.55k. However, the installation by JEEVES was not up to the mark.. The technician was not a professional and took a long time in setting up the TV.. further he came without an assistant, due to which I was forced to help him by holding the TV upright for almost 20 mts.. Not a nice experience at all.. However, I must reiterate the fact that the Xiaomi MI tv 65 inches in itself is a piece of art! Thanx XIAOMI once again"
744,4,Flagship product,Perfect choice and great deal #DiwaliWithMI Ordered for 50k and its a first MI 65 In TV in my town Excellent picture clarity experiencing 4K UHD Sound is fine but MI could improve more than 20W Connectivity is fine but sometimes it gets buffering and Bluetooth connectivity with BT speaker has a delay...
745,4,Good quality product,It was good but picture clarity was low but its valuable for money cheap and best product okay not bad overall good product
746,4,Value-for-money,Best in budget.. I got delivered on 14th of October after installing TV when I open and watch the picture quality it's awesome. sound is too good. 2gb ram is good for download your favorite apps. connectivity also good I'm using with my JIO net it's work nice. overall happy to buy.
747,4,Worth the money,guys the quality is good but i dont think there is much difference in HD and ultra hd i have been watching it since yesterday but i haven't noticed much diff and even no TV channel is available in HD only you can watch on Netflix but won't notice anything as there is very very minimal difference  not worth to pay extra 5 k
748,4,Good choice,sound is good enough for a medium hall range. DTS sound mentioned may be just a gimmick. picture wise viewing angles are good and refresh rate is fine. totally a valuable product in this price range.

760,4,Nice product,Picture quality and viewing angle excellent Sound is nice but it is better to have a speaker system for the the big screen User friendly os Fast installation NB : Don't compare this 4k tv with other brand such as Sony or LG . It is fact that it has 4k resolution. But colour reproduction is not much better as Sony or LG  But mi 4x is the best 4k Android TV at this price range
761,4,Value-for-money,Performance good Flipkart ship item good I received genion prodduct But instalation for mount person sell his wall mount item to very high price 1500rs and says in the box wall Mount material not good quality.
762,4,Pretty good,Got just in 24039 Value for money Installation done on after 2nd day of delivery.

Voice quality is good and video quality is awesome..just one issue that u have to face you have to press power on button every time you plug in you led its not automatically turn on
763,4,BEST 4K ANDROID TV AT THIS PRICE!,"REVIEW AFTER TWO WEEKS:  1. DISPLAY: Pretty good display (with decent colour accuracy) at this price. Viewing angles are not great. Colours change when we slightly shift our direction.  2. SOUND: Clear and crisp (Thanks to Dolby). But there's not much bass in it.  3. CONNECTIVITY: WiFi connectivity is decent. It switches off sometimes, especially in case of poor internet connection.  4. SMOOTHNESS: With 2GB of RAM, it manages everything perfectly. There are not much lags.  So, if you are looking for a 43"" 4K Android TV with a decent display and good sound quality (with less bass), then it is a Go-To- Buy!"
764,4,Good quality product,"Good television with best budget one can buy, overall its a good and connectivity is best and vedio quality would have been still better."
765,4,Nice product,"Good 4k tv Pros 1) Good picture quality 2) best android tv 3) patch wall is best stuff 4) remote is awesome Cons 1) sound is not upto the mark 2) SD channels gives blurr,only HDchannels works better 3)mirror casting missed"
766,4,Nice product,Mi 4k is awesome value for money in hd channels Dolby sounds work awesome but for as channels u have to connect extra speakers with bass over all good tv
767,4,Good choice,"Picture quality is good for HD and 4K, WiFi connectivity also fine. I am not satisfied with sound quality.. Overall it’s fine"
768,4,Good quality product,its a value for money product but do not expect more quality like compared to Soni or LG LED tv. but its complete budget TV for everyone I really enjoying
769,4,Value-for-money,mi led tv display is good and sound clarity is also good
770,4,Really Nice,"Using the product for couple of weeks. So far satisfied. It is very good value for the money however there are technical glitches and you would find tough if you are not so tech savvy... Some points worth to note, there is No background data saver option as advertised ; tv remote stopped working (power button) after (probably) a automatic software update. I had to factory reset to recover my remote power button. Patch wall is just a launcher (like what you see in your smartphone) all the pre installed app needs paid subscription (except you tube) so amount of free content is only in the advertisement.. This tv doesn't come with wall mount accessories.. Flip cart service took 500 to get the wall mount.. Tv panel is not fps like high end tvs... And don't expect the quality as Sony /Samsung /LG. However if you are not so sure and don't want to invest much on TV, then this is the option you may go for.. <25k for an uhd 43 inch is no brainer.. You simply can't beat this price and go wrong.."
771,4,Worth the money,"perfect product for this price , Excellent picture quality , sound is low as compare to mi 4c pro (32) but good , 4k contents on utube are excellent ,"
772,4,Pretty good,this TV is good in picture quality and also in sound quality...If anyone want a Good LED TV in this range....Go for it...
773,4,Very Good,"Budget 4k tv, its not bad at all however, Sound quality is not good at all, i mean you will have to increase the volume to hear the commentary when people are talking.connectivity to wifi is BAD..you will have the best results when you connect lan directly to the TV. That's the issue the company will need to resolve first as most houses would not be able to facilitate this. I have been using this for tv for two months now.. I'm happy once the lan was connected directly.i have not been using patchwall at all,im happy with Android. Most important point of this tv is the dual band wifi connection given.. not all tvs at this price have dual band wifi.please read about dual band wifi to know why it is relevant in 2020..takes time to start (less than a min)but its ok ,,no big deal..really its a tv for middle class to enjoy as your first foray in smart tv and that too in 4k..i recommend buy a usb drive and download any software on it instead of TV's internal storage..did not face any issue with mirroring or casting"
774,4,Value-for-money,Mi LED 4X is worth for money. The TV looks good and in size it's larger. The picture quality is better but there are some connectivity issues.The sound also seems to be good. Rather than connectivity issues it's overall good.
775,4,Value-for-money,Overall a satisfactory unit nothing like wow. Really disappointed with sound quality totally pathetic. You cannot hear anything clear in normal movies and only during any songs or action scenes suddenly sound picks up. No options to select any other sound mode or no equalizer make things very difficult. Have to keep volume levels really high to listen anything clearly. I should have trusted Sanyo over MI. Japanese rules in sound. Any suggestions to rectify this issue???
776,4,Very Good,"Writing this review after 1 day, I am fully satisfied with this Mi 4x 43"" TV. I got delivered this TV on 10th day as flipkart already said while placing the order. After delivery installation and demo done by Jeeves on next day in a very good manner. I want to wall mount the TV, so service engineer brings a good quality of metallic wall mount stand with him and I pay him 500 rs. After installation, I got an update of 875 MB & got new Miracast app for direct casting which is too good. If you want Miracast app for direct casting then you should go for the update. Wireless Connectivity is very good,there are no any problems faced. Picture quality 4/5, Sound quality 4/5, Connectivity 5/5. All the functions and features ie. Google Chromecast are working properly. I am not faced any problems. Remote working fine. USB ports, headphone jack and HDMI ports are working properly. SPDIF ports are not tested yet.But I don't think there will be any problems which will be I facing. HDMI 1 port I am using for my Tata Sky dish which is working fine. HD channels are very good to see. HD Channels 5/5, SD Channels 4/5. Viewing angle only from straight is very very good but from left and right is bad, picture quality turns in little bit whiteness. But it will not affect too much. From my opinion, you should definitely go for this TV. In this price this is very good TV. Calling and messaging by flipkart,delivery boy and installation boy is very good."
777,4,Really Nice,"Worth the money. Spending 3000 more than the other model is worth it.  Pros  Picture Sound Wifi (super speed) Ports  Cons  No free wall mount (pay 500 more) Remote is basic (Netflix and prime button are good though) Patchwall is little bit hard at first time Doesn't have much apps in playstore (amazon music , Jiosaavn not available) Native video player doesn't support subtitle"
778,4,Value-for-money,"I love it, it's the best .. value of money, installation also very good, but for Installation they've charged 2000 for the stand .. except this, everything is great"
779,4,Good choice,Fabulous product. The picture quality is really good and sound quality is remarkable. The connectivity is also seamless. The remote works perfectly. Highly satisfied with the product considering the price range. The only thing that dissapoints a bit is the operating system. The TV takes time to open up and there is bit of lag when it opens. Also when playing 4K content sometimes there the audio and video tracks are not in sync. You need to clear cache and restart the video to being them in sync. It's an OS issue and should be fixed by Mi via update.
780,4,Value-for-money,Good sound good picture awesome tv worth of money
781,4,Value-for-money,After using it for 15 days MI Led TV is a bang for buck in this price range I have not seen the display panel like MI TV and the same goes for the connectivity as well only the downside that I would say is for Speakers which are quite decent other than this MI TV 43 4x is a pick for sure
782,4,Good choice,good one for best prize. This doesnt support .srt file. I mean subtitles. Connectivity takes some time. other than this everything is absolutely fine. Good product
783,4,Very Good,"Value for money Picture and sound quality is good WiFi connctivity is good but Chromecast not working properly (it's okay with my one plus mobile, but not able to Chromecast through mi phone and laptop) Overall value for money, but need improvement in Chromecast But Flipkart delivery service was very poor,it took 20days for them to deliver the product even if the product is in the nearest hub for 9days"
784,4,Pretty good,I think 55 inch size is better than 43 inch picture quality of 43 is not so good but as compared to price it's so good
785,4,Aam Aadmi Review,"Before reviewing it, Let me recall the Mi TV 4X 43"" Price 25K with such high quality standard features. We call it Budget Smart TV.  Sound - 5/5 - No need of external sound systems.  Display - 3.5/5 - Black colour is not so good. But can be compensated a little when using Vivid display mode. - Screen resolution is good - Good Viewing angle makes it easy to watch  Build Quality - 3.5/5 - Display is loosely attached to bezel  Performance - 3.5/5 - It lags a little during screen navigation. - Takes little longer to Start and Shutdown.  Overall I would rate it as 4/5. We should not forget the TV Price. Mi TV 4X 43"" inch is worth its price.  I did see few review comments regarding Wifi connectivity issue. I didn't face disconnecting issue till now. WiFi seems working perfectly fine."
786,4,Really Nice,delivery is good but installation is not good. overall good TV for 25000.very well satisfied
787,4,Good quality product,"The picture is very nice,colours are vibrant too.But the problem is on sound,it has a good base and bgm can be heard clearly but u can't hear voice ,especially when watching movies .but during songs and cricket commentary the voices are loud.but if you watch any movie you can never hear the voice clearly that is the major defect."
788,4,Wonderful,good picture quality at this price range.. youtube sometimes lag. wifi connection also become lag sometime. we have to restart it again. after the connection become ok.. the tv is very fast and no lag at anytime and the google voice assistant works very fine. whike playing youtube just say only on the remote.. very fast result.. overall very good tv at this price range.
789,4,Nice product,Delivered on time. I’m writing this review on the 1st day of use. I will submit the complete review again after one month of usage. Picture quality is good on HD channels and online streaming. Sound clarity also good. But quality of the product has to improve especially panel framing on display. While playing with mirror cast on iPhone (hot star movies) audio is coming but video is not coming. Connectivity issues are there at the beginning while connecting our android phone. It taking maximum time.
790,4,Really Nice,I am writing this review after a month pros 1.nice vibrant display 2. inbuilt apps Netflix primevideo hotstar etc .though hotstar doesn't have live TV functionality even for a premium subscription where as mobile app provides live tv features 3.sound is normal not the best  4. connectivity too is ok. 5. remote is simple but lacks basic functionality buttons cons 1.remote power off button worked initially but after 15 days didn't work. software issue. after reset only worked for me. but need to install all the apps again.its irritating 2. product description says it has data saver option.but this 43inch TV doesn't have. 3.sound picture option can't be changed directly while using internet. need to go back and change by stopping the playing content overall all at this price range it is ok to buy
791,4,Good choice,"display setting for changing parameters does not work at all. even u do brightness zero, still it will be same and if u do 100% still it will be same. neither brightness, nor sharpness nor any other parameter work. unfortunately u can not adjust display brightness/colour/other parameter, options for change r available but it does not work at all. rest every thing i found ok."
792,4,Worth the money,"Best product but buy it from MI website or other place to get fast and quick delivery. Pros- 1 Picture quality is best, 4k resolution gives better picture.Set backlight and other picture setting for best experience. 2 Sound is fabulous. Just change sound setting from standard to music or custom it. 3 Take automatic updates. It updates periodically for new features. 4 Patchwall is at its best. All apps set up on it. 5 Quick connection to any device. Chromecast works very well. 6 Netflix youtube prime videos and other apps run smoothly. No hang problem. 7 Quick response remote. 8 Support 2 TB hardisk ( I take trial upto 2 TB). Directly play contained from it. 9 HDMI ports are well set up. DTH can be mounted on it. 10 Can be used for Play station and monitor for PC if do design work. Cons- 1 Late delivery by Flipkart, faster delivery options not available. It take nearly 15 days to deliver. 2 Worst quality of stand provided with it. It's made of plastic. 3 No batteries included in remote.  Overall a good product. Definitely buy."
793,4,Worth the money,"In this price range you cannot ask for more because this TV has it all.  The picture quality is totally awesome which is further added with it's 178° Viewing angle that doesn't disappoint.  The sound quality needs more work because the main and background sound seem distinct and not attached with each other i.e the background sound is very dim. Although, you can curb that problem by connecting your sound system with by bluetooth or a 3-pin Woofer.  Apart from that, Great work. It's a no look deal, just grab it and go."
794,4,Pretty good,Nice product. Mi is just fabulous which is providing such a great product in this price range. Lokking forward with best life time and service support from mi/Xiomi. nice work from jeeves technician Mr.Tejas. Good demo presentation. Overall satisfied with the product. @ Flipkart: Not happy with flipkart delivery commitments. Please take care from next time
795,4,Nice product,"this tv good with 4k video but not satisfied with set top box,cromcast is lege not properly work,no data savar mode,remot,s on off key not working properly,i am not satisfied with this product. installation period sooooo long."
796,4,Good choice,Picture was gud as per the clarity of your video..just gud in this budget can’t say excellent or compare with big brands...you can go for it blindly if not expecting crystal clear picture
797,4,Pretty good,it's an amazing tv .. and made the right choice to buy it here ... totally worth the product s as discribed. the connectivity s awesome and totally satisfied.. go for t .
798,4,Worth the money,All good for now..! 720p quality was too bad and 1080p 60fps is good and 1080 less then 60fps is also too bad telugu channels was not good if we see from long distance it's look good. But if your having big size room you must and should have extra speaker setup because the full volume of tv is too low i didn't expect that. Delivery date was too long as it is common in Flipkart 😅. Tv is Lags if we are using fast tv was not that much fast response don't expect TV's like OnePlus and other with some high quality TV's
799,4,Good choice,"Installation :- same day of delivery .  In this budget perfect tv , picture quality :- good , sound quality :- also good untill there is no issue . So worth buying it"
800,4,Wonderful,Really nice TV at this range Wi-Fi connectivity is really smooth only delivery was late but after updating TV chromecast doesn't support movies from phone it's supports only YouTube don't know why this update isn't supporting movies from my local video player please fix this problem
801,4,Very Good,"Flipkart delivery was on time, but the installation service provider which is given by Jeeves was not on time... MI 4k TV provides great features in this affordable price.. the picture clarity and sound is good..."
802,4,Good choice,"manufacturer not checked properly and not set back side screw's properly . overall it's ok for 4k digital clearty , sound only 4k videos and not good for normal video mode."
803,4,Best in this range | Could better few things,"Overall I am happy with my new MI 4x 43 inches TV, and I am writing my experience here:  1. 4K and HD quality works excellent with this TV. 2. In most of other user reviews I seen they mentioned about TV Audio quality is not up to mark. however i analysed this point very closely and found, Sound is Good and audible clearly, but sound quality going UP/Down on the basis of applications from where you run the your audio/video song. 3. There are no in-built voltage stabilize, you should have to buy it, if light fluctuation in your area. 4. During installation, my Jeeves’s representative told me, if we don't install voltage stabilizer at the time of installation, we don't cover warrant of TV if something happened due to voltage fluctuation. I didn't get reply over this from Flip cart till now, will update you guys, and once get any update on this. 5. Quality of stand is not up to mark, seems very low quality. 6. For wall mount you don't need to pay any extra penny to Jeeves person, as it’s already free. Only you have to pay INR 500, if you purchased wall mount from that person. 7. There are no option to mute audio, which I think MI missed. There should be mute option at report. 8. Build quality is low, if you touch corner of TV, you found some gap. 9. SD channels is display is not good, you could found better experience with at least 780 Resolution video. 10. Screen mirroring option is available with this TV and working fine. 11. Up time is little bit high as compared to other branded TVs like Samsung and Sony 12. No Lag to play video, if you have good internet speed. you should have at least 20 mbps speed to watch 4k videos 13. It hang, you give multiple command through Google Assistance. else, Google assistance work flawless. 14. Approx. 4.4 GB space available to use initially. 15. They mentioned it have HDR 10, I don't think it have, however picture quality is good. 16. In dark screen, picture quality get little bit down, I don't think it have more than 200 - 250 nits brightness"
804,4,Wonderful,good product average picture quality and good sound but connectivity is excellent this product is value for money good experience
805,4,Worth the money,"The Picture quality of the Mi TV is very good, Sound quality was better than tv quality, the price is very good and very affordable Mi Tv, the engineer installing the tv take a couple of the days to install the tv"
806,4,Value-for-money,very good 4k tv at this price. totally worth this price range. planty of online content and good picture quality. sound is also good for small leaving room.for bigger leaving room you can connect sound bar for better sound.
807,4,Good choice,before purchase this smart TV I think that all the contents on patchwal is free of cost only required internet connection... but almost 80% are payble and need subscription.... MI as a brand should provide their own free contents in their next update.
808,4,Value-for-money,Everything is ok in tv but quality of tv look like average. if MI give good quality of the body tv will be awesome
809,4,Pretty good,Everything is awsome in this price point but it is to be note that no downloading can be done so no jio tv and chrome is also not there but tv is awesome with good picture quality and sound. no need of sound bar in a small room delivery is too late 9 days for delivery that is why 3 stars and jeeves was also very good got message for next day delivery but done on the day of delivery itself .  So I am Happy with this product
810,4,Value-for-money,A good package 4k tv. picture quality is good 5/4.5 need some work on sound quality 5/4 connectivity 5/5 best 4k tv in this price range..👍👍
811,4,Really Nice,Best option at low range price..gives competition to upper segments..but few things need to be address like sound quality is not good enough as well as issues with forwarding videos like on prime videos if forward the video for few second..then you will see audio is not matching with video...apart of these its a perfect buy option at lower range!!!
812,4,Pretty good,TV is very good much better then earlier model s of Mi . but issue is Flipkart is selling complete TV protection with TV . But when product is delivered they are converting it to extended warranty instead of complete protection . so don't buy complete protection because they will send you extended warranty instead of complete TV protection.
813,4,Wonderful,Picture quality is very good for 4K and HD and good for SD channels and also sound is very good. Got hanged while checking for screen mirroring. Overall it's good one.
814,4,Value-for-money,nice product
815,4,Nice product,Good product.
816,4,Good quality product,just to say for this..less price value of product as compared to this product .picture and sound quality awesome..am just love it .Ty MI
817,4,Good quality product,Its Humongous. Its like mini Theater. Value for money. Connectivity ports are difficult to access when wall mounted. 0 Star for Flipkart Delivery.
818,4,Delightful,screen mirroring is not getting
819,4,Worth the money,Request to everyone plz plz plz plz don't buy this tv..within a 20 days my tv mother board gone...mi replacing mother board but don't know how it's life...plz go for a other brands expect mi tv

821,4,Nice product,"Picture quality is good , sound is ok.."
822,4,Nice product,"Most important issue I faced was connectivity issues with WiFi and was very annoying. Tried all suggestions from others like configuring static IP, rebooting WiFi/TV,etc many times. The issue was resolved by applying latest update. If not for that, I would have returned the TV!! Hope this helps."
823,4,Wonderful,Value for Money. TV quality owsm...Picture quality also very Good.
824,4,Nice product,at this price this product is very good. only problem is the Chromecast feature doesn't work without a network ... there should have been a wifi direct connection like wireless display. Update after 6 month of usage Pros 1. Value for money 2. Simplistic UI 3. Slim profile 4. Good display Cons 1. Connectivity issue sometime 2. Speaker could have been better 3. Wall mount not included
825,4,Pretty good,"worth buying this product in today's market at decent price wen u compare to LG, Sony, Samsung.. but got no idea how many years will this TV survive"
826,4,Very Good,"Review of MI Tv: This is probably the best TV you can buy at this price range. Everything is great about the TV except sound. Sound quality is too average and not consistent. Review of Jeeves installation team : This is the worst part of buying this TV. TV will be delivered on time but nobody turns up for installation. Then you escalate the issue with flipkart, they reply saying issue is escalated and will resolved by new deadline. Again nobody turns up and you frustratingly contact flipkart customer support for the same, they reply the same automated response and give you a new deadline and again nobody turns up. Now you decide its not worth the hassle and then you decide to return product and that is when flipkart tries and get someone to you for installation."
827,4,Really Nice,nice product
828,4,Wonderful,Overall its a good product in this price range. Display is awesome so as the sound..Good build quality..Patch wall just creates confusion for users there is nothing comes free in this world and you have to pay for everything!!
829,4,Delightful,Super Tv..... But Small Problem there if connected bluetooth speaker its automatic hang some times... then over Good Tv...
830,4,Delightful,nice
831,4,Pretty good,value for money supefrb tv go and purchase superoooo super
832,4,Very Good,Connectivity issue while screen mirroring from mobile phone.
833,4,Value-for-money,"If you want to buy this product for Netflix and Amazon only then don’t buy, I bough this on 14th oct and after configuration I found Netflix is not working. The video screen is getting stuck while loading on 99% but audio is coming in background.  I called MI support but they are saying there is no such an issue then I raise one ticket for support and local support guy called me and said that there is a bug in Netflix and Amazon prime application and it is very common in this TV. He also said they don’t have any patch for this bug and MI is also not confirming when they are going to fix the same.  I really screwed to find this as I bought this one for Netflix only.  Also I would like to add one more point here. If you are playing 4K video from YouTube or USB the video is getting stuck while playing many times, seems the hardware is also not good enough to handle 4K video smoothly.  #######. PLEASE DON’T BUY #########"
834,4,Pretty good,"Just don't buy this Tv even in this prize.even this prize is more than enough for this Tv. I have started facing problems within 10 days of use.connectivity issue,sound issue,you can't use this more than 3 hours continuously.my tv screen divided into 2 parts after using 3 hours a day. just don't go for this Tv."
835,4,Nice product,Value for money
836,4,Pretty good,Picture quality is very good. Bit of Issues in screen mirroring. Connectivity is quite okay. The installation partner which Flipkart has choose - Jeeves - is not supportive and not ready to help proper with demo. they just install.
837,4,Good quality product,Overall good product with best price but instalation and demo too bad
838,4,Wonderful,"product is good but unsatisfied with installation service,took 5 days and continues"
839,4,Worth the money,"after watching this tv around one month I am reviewing it. I ordered it on 30th sep on sell but I got the TV on 22nd October 2019, so there was 22days to deliver that product. So I will give One star for the speed of the delivey. But after installation of this TV I will give A big thanks to MI to making this tv. picture quality is quite good. Sound quality is very nice. I bought Sound bar seperatedly but for my room is it not required because tv aound is realy nice. overall A good product. value for money."
840,4,Good quality product,Very Good tv for the price. However newer TV's have better speakers and Dolby sound. The picture quality is not upto samsung or sony panels(obviously). I use it with ps4 and doesn't have any problem. The only problem im facing is that I can't change sound output when the 3.5mm jack is plugged in. I'll have to remove 3.5mm everytime I want the sound to come from the TV inbuilt speakers. The alternative is to buy a coaxial to 3.5mm dac or a hdmi dac.
841,4,Very Good,"Maybe it has low price compared to other brands in this range but seriously lot of connectivity issues and sound is terrible , Screen cast doesn't work. WIFI connectivity has issues . Picture quality is Average , Honestly Buy some good brand like Sony or Samsung ."
842,4,Good quality product,"The product is good but little bit disappointed by jeeves. Com for delay in allotment of technicians. My tv installed by Mr. T Venkatesh, in very professional manner. He is very gentle."

846,4,Delightful,picture quality is good at this range but sound quality is the worst. sound is very very low. looks are below average. but value for money. but mitv 4x doesn't comes with pathwall 2.0 and data saver yet. Why they are advising this.

861,4,Really Nice,Very nice

863,4,Nice product,"I was having issue with soundbar output, technician saying this TV has issue with HDMI ARC output and it won't solve 99%, I was very disappointed and thought to return this. Imagine You have expensive soundbar and you are not able to connect with HDMI, it was working with Bluetooth though.  Finally from Internet I found some solution with some setting output through HDMI ARC is working smoothly now. TV is very good with in this budget."
864,4,Wonderful,Nice
865,4,Very Good,MI 4X nice product It is Best 4k TV for 25000 Good quality I was using MI 4X Tv for 1 week there is no problem I faced on this tv

867,4,Very Good,Nice Thanks to Flipkart
868,4,Really Nice,Good android TV
869,4,Nice product,Picture Quality is great with modes to adjust. Good viewing angle. There is noise in the sound at high volumes but rarely used such high volumes. Connectivity is fine with WiFi proximity  Good deal go for it

874,4,Nice product,Product is good but improper and unsatisfied installation by jeeves
875,4,Good quality product,Delivered on time Installed properly Quality is good  But please don't compare it with sony TV Mi TV is no match for sony on picture quality Picture appears fade
876,4,Value-for-money,"Quality of picture no dought good. If 4K signal is not available in cable, the effect can't be realised. But any one can check the picture by 4K quality video. Connectivity is problematic by mobile with youtube.. I have received distorted picture but I hope it is for data speed of mobile which is too low to run 4K video, if data speed high then quality will be better."
877,4,Wonderful,"Picture quality is good. Its sound quality is required to be improved. One main concern is that, on mobile hotspot connection, it does not continuosly shows 720p videos. It takes more time for buffering. But for 360p-480p resolution, videos run continuosly."
878,4,Really Nice,Fabulous product. I gave 5stars

886,4,Very Good,"Product is value for money, I like picture quality. Lacking in connectivity And sound is very low, even I am using full volume to hear that properly. That is quite disappointing. Also want to add that all ports are not easy to reach, I bought 65"" and to reach all the ports you have to use extensions. This is an negetive point I would like to highlight"
887,4,Good choice,Sound is too good... Picture quality is crystal clear WiFi got connected easily Remote can be made more good for swift typing
888,4,Worth the money,Picture quality is best in segment... I just have problem with sound its not that much good... But we can fix that by using good pair of speaker or home theatre... Try to buy wallmount online because that fitting guys charge more money..
889,4,Wonderful,Really Good value of Money

1005,4,Pretty good,Hi here is my review : Picture : quality is good but I haven't feeled it as ultra hd 4k type. :) Sound : not loud; even I used it in small room. You may require home theater system for better sound. :/ Connectivity : very good UI and apps works smoothly. You just need a good wifi connection. :) Overall one may go with this product as it's seems big on wall and for middle class family it's a good choice; as we don't want too big and too small. :) Let me know for your votes and suggestions. :)
1006,4,Delightful,User interface is complicated to use as DTH .Overall good tv to buy.I will rate it 4.2 star.

1146,4,Delightful,Piture and sound is superb inthis price range . Delivery and installation on time. Taking more time to switch On That is main con
1147,4,Nice product,Good Tv but price is little More
1148,4,Wonderful,Good
1149,4,Value-for-money,This TV is supplied with a bluetooth remote. And pairing with other DTH remotes may not be possible.
1150,4,Delightful,Android takes a bit to boot up. But once booted up works like magic. Good internet reception. Tata sky works flawlessly. Sound is terrible (i am told its a thing with all new TVs). Low levels and also dialogue -BGM optimization is poor. Great picture quality (tata sky hd). Remote has direct buttons for prime and Netflix. Very useful.
1151,4,Pretty good,Before reading thus or any review one must make piece with the fact that they are looking for a budget TV not some premium SONY or Samsung TV.. For the price picture is prety good...though I believe a lot depends on the source and internet speed for quality pictures. Software and connectivity is good. Sound quality is really bad. I bought it knowing about that deficit. I use my Samsung Buds via Bluetooth for viewing most of the times so it's not an issue for me.. for others I thing a simple 3k sound bar or tower can do the trick
1152,4,Very Good,good value for money
1153,4,Nice product,It's good 4k TV as compair to other Brands price and features. It was awesome TV with use of 1 month experience.

1188,4,Really Nice,"The tv is really good but I got it for 29000/- as there was no other good tv in this range , it was of 24,999/- before but the price increased quickly , it has been 7 days I am using the tv  * Pros : 1. Far better than nokia , realme & motorola tv. 2. The picture quality is really impressive & the colours are accurate. 3. 20w sound far better than nokia's so called onkyo 39w sound bar.  * Cons : 1. The price is bit overhead , if you're buying it till 26k then its value for money. 2. Tv takes a lot of time ( approx 1.5 mins - 2 mins ) to boot , which is sometimes annoying. 3. Lags very much , the remote input & tv output is lagging. 4. No wall mount provided my Mi , I don't know if it's only because it's on Flipkart , but you have to pay additional 500rs for wall mount.   Overall it's a nice tv to get under 26000/-"

The good part for me is under my budget and value for my money. I want to purchase a Mi Q1 55-inch for a good viewing experience but have no enough space on the room wall. however, I am happy with the 43-inch model. I am a fan of buying a branded product but this time decided to choose differently. Service and installation were good no issue it was done the next day after received the product."

1350,4,Pretty good,Picture quality is good. I am using HD set top box. May be 4k would have better quality. HD channels will not good quality in 43 inch. The TV definitely takes a long time to start. It takes approximately 45 secs to start as it is Android. Connectivity is good as it has all features. Sound is bit slow as compared to my earlier LG tv.

1379,4,Nice product,i brought it for 2400 . if u have ur budget around 22 - 26 k . then with close eyes u can go with this tv. other wise. samsung lg sony r best
1380,4,Good choice,Good product for the price
1381,4,Really Nice,Good compare to top brands
1382,4,Good quality product,It's a good TV.. Pictures really sharp... However the bright portions are too white (not natural).. Changing modes didn't help.  Main question is how long do these TVs last.. Only time will tell..
1383,4,Very Good,"Ive using the tv for more than 7 months.  Its good comparative to other tv avaliable in this price segment the apps availability is great and the optimization of the UI is sleek and good  In the 1st 4 month's i didn't able to screen cast in the tv, after the update A new miracast app given by the side of MI.  Its good when came to update MI done a great job.  Simply the Tv is value for monet product with lot of good features. It's provide good features. That's provided by the costly brand like samsung, sony e.t.c In the segment of below 40k. More or less the screen quality is same in the device compare to MI 4X UHD TV to samsung.,and sony devices below 40 k  When the concern is starts in the build quality. The build quality is average compare to other device.   Connectivity : When came to connectivity MI done's a great job. The remote is very easy to use. If they put the mute button in future its very usefull  My score out of 10 is 7.5 to the tv.  I give 10/10 to value for money. In the segment its perform 90% to the given money  Definitely it's a beast on the budget under 26k"

1394,4,Worth the money,"Good product, worth for money"
1395,4,Good choice,"It supports all kinds of Pictures, even 10bit X265 hevc ones. But not Dolby Atmos sound. If you have external media, then you need to convert that into 6CH audio or compress into normal 2CH Audio. 4K videos don't lag normally unless it's from very high source. 1080p videos look decent enough on 43 inch, but if you're going for 65 inch variants, then the picture might seem a bit deranged. The colors vibrant enough when you're playing 10bit HDR contents. Anyway, good for value."

1460,4,TV is very good but installation team gave me a hardtime.,"Till now the TV is functioning as expected. The installation team really gave me a hard time , once they didnt had the wall mount, next time the installation guy was completely unaware about everything and seemed to be not interested in installing. Third time the guy came with only movable wall mount and he didnt bring the fixed wallmount which I had requested multiple times. So i had to get the movable wallmount installed and they charged 1600rs for the same.  TV is very good and I am satisfied with the same, Only drawback is that it doesn't have the MUTE button on the remote."

1462,4,Very Good,Brought around 20 days back. Picture quality is good and build quality is good Faced one issue with sound bar. Actually tried with zebronics soundbar to connect with hdmi arc it is not compatible also tried with JBL sound bar then i got to know that issue with tv..later found some articles like mi tv have connectivity issues with sound bar Mi need update the software to provide some setup/sync properly with sound bar  Issue with sound bar is: it connects with arc but whenever tv power off upon on it is not syncing with sound bar eventhough CEC enabled. If mi fixes or provide setup that would be great..

1513,4,Good choice,Worth for it in this price range
1514,4,Good choice,The product is good and is a great value for money. Only issue is with the connectivity. The TV doesn't detect Wi-fi network and requires formatting. Also there is some issue with screen mirroring. It gets disconnected on its own frequently.

1516,4,Really Nice,Good products
1517,4,Value-for-money,Though best TV in the range of features (43inches-ultra HD-4k) but I still have no idea how to improve colors and sound... can't find the option and afraid that they haven't given that either

1524,4,Good Purchase with Few Limitations,"The picture / video quality is not as great as Sony / Samsung televisions. Not 4K quality. However not bad on this price. Apps take a while to open but in couple of days you are used to it. One star reduced because the connecting ports are on back and not laterally. They should be on either side. It is difficult to join or remove any connection from back in routine.  Suggestion : Since remote control have very limited keys / buttons, better purchase an additional rechargeable keyboard based bluetooth remote to operate features like navigation, easy typing etc."

1531,4,Good quality product,"Mi 4X 43 HDR TV is very good than expectations. Delivery is quickly,but installation executive was hurriedly installed without giving proper information. Only he was interested to take TV stand, stabilizer and for extending flipcart warranty. Except that product is so good. YouTube 4k video quality is excellent. Mobile net connectivity is troublesome."

1536,4,Pretty good,Posting a honest review about the product as I was having some doubts when I was about to purchase it but it crushed all my doubts when it arrived. 1. I read all reviews about this and most of the reviews were about connectivity issues and that was my major concern as I am a youtube and Netflix person but at my home I have bsnl broadband that has lowest connectivity and bandwidth and on that it connects proper and don't gave me any issue.  So at this price I will say close your eyes and go for it and yes I don't talked about other features because that all are just superb🔥
1537,4,Good quality product,At this price it's ok to buy
1538,4,Nice product,"It's a brilliant very smart TV is full HD and the best is that you have a very good price, so I think it's A1 TV."

1549,4,Good choice,"This is a review after go through Mi 4x 4k 43 inch  Pros.  1. Good picture quality with 10 bit panel 2. ARC works fine with sony 5.1 surround sound 3. All TV version Android apps running including other source apps which you can download from third party 4. All type of video and audio format supported through USB 5. And the most important part that bothered me most before purchase. Yes you can use it as 4k monitor with high performance graphics PC with high speed HDMI 2.0 cable. Don't ask about chroma certification, I don't know, I tried to find that out but its specified no where for MI 4X. I tried 4K gaming and its worked fine with 50 FPS that decent performance. And no text scramble so guess it has chroma 4:4:4 6. Design good. Small basle. 7. TV inbuilt speakers are good 8. Got one day delivery and one day installation... So Flipkart thank-you  Cons.  1. Remote is too basic. It was good for MI Box but not good for TV. TV needs much more control. Not suggested for non tech savvy people. 2. Setting is too basic too, can't control picture quality customisation, only 7 pre set picture mode present. 3. Picture modes can't be changed when video running on Android app so no preview available. If video run through HDMI then you can change picture mode with preview. 4. Now the most disappointing part, HDR 10 videos became more dull than normal video. Its a HDR 10 TV but when running HDR 4k video quality colours washed out. Its really un expected from this TV. I hope MI will provide some solutions with future software updates. Normal 4K videos r good but not HDR. 5. Installation guy took over amount for movable wall-mount installation. Took 1800/- but when I call MI official they told it should cost 1200/-"

1598,4,Good choice,Really great product 👍
1599,4,overall a decent TV,"As of now this TV looks good. picture quality is quite good. sound quality is decent or OK. Remote and TV build quality is good. Connectivity is bit slow. TV reboot takes about 1 minute. All communication ports are given on RHS of TV panel. TV installation was quick and scheduled very next day of delivery. There is no optical output port given in this TV, which is very big disappointment. Also only TV power cable comes with this TV. No other cables or wall mount bracket is supplied in the box. TV Remote comes without battery (keep 2 nos. AAA battery ready with you before installation guy comes at your doorstep) . Mi tried to cut every single penny they could save. There is nothing very fantastic about this TV, which could give edge over other brands, but Overall this TV looks good deal for me. Also buying 3yr TV protection will ensure which-ever brand you choose, will survive for at least next 3 years. I dont think brand name matters these days. Better to go for best price deal with additional TV protection plan."

1614,4,Worth the money,"Best 4K tv with trustable company and patchwall. Pros everyone knows Cons :- Connectivity issue  I spent more than a week trying all possible thing. I suggest to connect your Mi TV with ethernet for best connectivity and lag free experience. Dual band wifi or wide range wifi might also work. But general basic mi router or other brand doesn't work well.  Other than that, tv is flawless"

1641,4,Worth the money,Picture Quality is Good for the price you paid. However the sound Quality is not so impressive. Features wise advanced TV. There is some lag while moving to other applications. However need to see the durability.
1642,4,Delightful,perfect picture quality but flat sound not ideal.
1643,4,Delightful,"Great TV for price, 4k panel is really great but can have more crispy colours, and the texture is not that good as reflections make it impossible to see the TV, but i would really recommend it if you want an upgrade from some CRT or any 720p it is really good TV. The sound is good for a 10 by 10 room but for a bigger room its decent, Software experience is good, Patchwall is a little bulky but it is great UI and you wont enjoy the plain android experience later, I hope patchwall would have been more customisable. Overall experience: Good software, decent panel and sound, totally recommended for a room of size 10 by 10 feet. Wait for the offers you can it cheap here than any other store."

1649,4,Good choice,Important Update CNC must be on for ARC to work which is hidden in input setting. Superb TV but Technician fitted this Wall mount without letting me known that its for 32 inch to 55 inch where as my TV has 65 inch. I noticed this after he fitted and left my place. He charged me Rs.1600 for this which is ok but my concern is this stand hold weight of TV for long run. Attached photo of Wall mount Box which clearly shows 32 to 55 inch. Now after wifi connection when tried to use youtube and playstore it didn't work even after having 20mbps connection.

1695,4,Value-for-money,If your budget is low best option.requirement to Sony brand for good picture quality.
1696,4,Very Good,"Price wise definitely a great purchase as for other brands you have to spend extra 5-10 k. Picture quality is good but not that great as like top 4K tv brands. Sound is good. If this is your first 4K tv then go for it. User interface of patchwall is easy to navigate. Time lag to start apps/swich windows is there. My other tv of LG is definitely far better than this but as a secondary tv this is good. Don't forget to but MI IR cable to operate set top box using mi tv remote. If your are looking for best picture quality, best sound etc then LG/Sony should be in your mind. I would still recommend this tv due to overall price and performance."

Flipkart executives couldn't find the exact issue, why it has not been delivered, at last I contact Jeeves, the seller, they only informed me that flipkart has not invoiced the complete protection plan and hence they are not aware about the order. Atleast i received the details after 20 days and 7 complaint registration."

There is no issue with the connectivity. Everything works great. 4. Tv lags for first 5 min after switch on. After that it works smoothly. Conclusion : It a great buy at this price. Go for it if Hisense and VU is out of stock."

1776,4,Really Nice,Good one
1777,4,Value-for-money,Nice
1778,4,Wonderful,Reviewing after two months of active usage. Definitely a good upgrade over my TCL Full HD..Blacks are not as dark as Samsung VA monitor..Color vividness is little less when viewed from side angles. Android OS takes a bit time to load up on starting up but works pretty fast once loaded. Does not allow to change picture and sound settings while viewing online content and everytime have to come on to the home screen to make any changes..that's more of a drawback for Android OS.. Sound quality is decent and can get loud enough for a mid size drawing room..Vocal clarity and mids are sharp..bass is low as expected from a TV..got a Panasonic Soundbar for better sound.. Configuring HDMI Arc is a little tricky on this and could not detect the soundbar at multiple attempts using different HDMI cables.. Finally got one cable to work with HDMI Arc functionality.. For HDMI Arc functionality try using these steps: detach all HDMI cables and turn off both TV and soundbar and also remove from main power supply..keep them shut for more than a minute..now plug in both ends of HDMI cable with soundbar and TV...turn on TV first and then soundbar..if lucky HDMI Arc would work!

Absolute 4K experience for this price is great... Coming to the sound, Default inbuilt speakers are giving an awesome sound effects. Definitely you will be experiencing a good sound quality. Now I should also comment on the connectivity part.. I've tried using my Mobile hotspot to in this Smart TV but i face some automatic disconnection issues and again i have to connect back the hotspot manually but this is not often.. I suspect this issue occurs due to mobile issue but not sure.. I'll be installing the broadband connection soon and test the hotspot. Over all the experience is great and the TV is really Value for money. Patchwall feature is really brilliant.. Installation technician was also very polite, punctual and well experienced person.. Thanks."

1803,4,Delightful,In case you are using it with Jio set top box you will observe frequent frame drops especially while watching sports it is very irritating. Otherwise the picture quality is good. The 65 inch display is immersive and huge. Please ensure you have viewing distance or the view would look unrealistic
1804,4,Good quality product,Other than connectivity this is the best tv for this price and seems little bit has been taken to turn on the tv

I have tried every settings and saw tons of videos in YouTube And i even changed static IP to DHCP manual method but doesn't work for TV.. at one moment it worked and after restarting TV. It stopped working again. Final conclusion= Lan port doesn't work at all.  2. Wifi range is too low.. We have to keep wifi router very close to TV in order to stream 1080p videos.  Apart from connectivity everything working good.

1818,4,Wonderful,"One month of use with the TV. Pros 1. Light weight 2.Pic quality Cons 1.Sound quality and audibility 2. Connectivity is almost non existent. Need to connect the TV with the mobile hotspot to connect. Ironically, the mobile uses the same wifi which MiTV refuses to open any of the streaming apps and playstore. 3. Remote is not user friendly"
1819,4,Very Good,"Tv is good especially for the people coming from CRT era. The quality is decent and satisfying for the price. Patchwall is a gimmick and don't fall for it. Also, tv sound is something which is loud but not that good in terms of clarity.  For this price, we don't have much competition and so i would recommend it to you. Animated stuff and 4k stuff are treat to watch."
1820,4,Good choice,"Writing this review after using it for a week, price i paid Rs 24924/ along with 3 yrs totall protection.  Picture:- 4/5. Colours cool quite good but the crispness to be wow is left.but in this price very well done.  Sound:- 4/5. Pretty decent in low volume, sound is good. in high it's ok but the Bass and clearty of different tones is not available.but in this price it's decent.  OS:- 4/5. The OS takes exactly 55 seconds to load.the patchwall looks good and easy navigation.  App:- Netflix, Primevideo, YouTube preloaded and rest app you can load from playstore.  Connectivity:- is good. Mi remote is quick responsive. along with remote I was able to connect bluetooth headphone without any problem.  Installation:- installation person came same day after delivery. Mi doesn't give wall mount so had to purchase from him at price of Rs 850/. Other than that no money for installation."

1960,4,Good choice,super
1961,4,Delightful,"Most detailed review  --- A could not be better product at the price point for sure ---  Its an LCD pannel with LED backlight and hence it's heavy on power consumption, 105W, which is pretty high for day to day use of a TV. One should try to get a TV with LED pannel in order to stay energy and bill concious. Picture quality is unquestionable. Plays 4K videos like a charm and seamlessly, if your internet is fast enough of course. Sound is decent, not something worth a special mention. No bass at all, neither expected. WiFi connectivity range for this device is just as good as modern day mobile phones, compared to even normal laptops the WiFi connectivity range is much worse. Bluetooth connectivity range is just as normal. I have experienced few small lags, not too frequently. One bug is that while operating with voice command sometimes the TV sound stops to work completely and that is truly annoying. You will have to restart the TV to get going again. Slowness in operation while working with Google assistant is quite noticeable, and not because of internet speed.  OS, UI & user-friendlyness:  Mi Patchwall home screen looks charming but I wish it could be more useful like when it comes to switching between apps there should be a button available on the remote to toggle between all running apps at the time like the case in Android smartphones. But truly thats a feature missing in the OS not in this specific TV or Patchwall. Also the recently viewed items section could be very helpful if not for the fact that it does not bring recent items from all the apps, like in my case it only shows the items watched in Hotstar. Also some apps take much longer to load than others like Hotstar is superfast where as Prime Video takes a while. Google assistant and voice search are useful, differently with different apps. Like with YouTube you will not be needing a keyboard ever, the voice search is ok there but with other apps, you can open the app with voice command, but not really search anything within it using voice search. And it's quite silly and weird if you have to type with a remote. This last point need no concern if everytime you cast content from your phone. Built in Chromecast is just awesome. Also using Miracast you can clone you smartphone's screen on the TV which provides great flexibility.  Verdict:  If you are excited with the concept of Android TV(my case exactly) and on a tight budget also looking for experiencing true 4K, then this the product for you. The trade off is in terns of energy inefficiency and small lags here and there. If your looking for uncompromised quality and performance, well do more research.  ! Most important suggestion !  For on-wall installation do not go for installation by Flipkart/Jeevs. Their service person is less than useless and they charge 500 for the wall bracket which is available online at cheaper price also the quality is better there. Just go for a tabletop installation when Flipkart installation team approaches you and afterward mount it on wall yourself or get help from local electrician. Much better option in my opinion."

1971,4,Value-for-money,"First impression was good.. I got Android 9 update. I have so many reviews for connectivity issues but I didn't face any issue. If our our Internet is slow then it takes time buffer and chrome cast lag.  Display is also good and sound is enough for normal viewers. I tried Hotstar, Prime and Netflix and all are working fine"
1972,4,Delightful,Its good..must buy
1973,4,Wonderful,"Picture quality is good enought for users looking for an entry into 4K Viewing. Sound quality is also good enough for an average viewer; however, you can always connect a Bluetooth soundbar for better sound. Connectivity on the 5GHz band is not consistent and keeps dropping during prolonged viewing.  Overall, its a great buy in the price range and if you are not concerned with the technical specs and response time of the tv then you would be satisfied with the buy."

The very next day I received my product samsung people contacted me and give a full demo and installation.  This TV has only 2 star rating for energy consumption. Those who are ok with it, can buy the product with no doubt."

277,3,Fair,"Tv picture quality is ok.....It depends upon your strength of internet connection. Tizen OS is smooth....No lag Sound is good The only minus point for this tv I noticed is , the remote is not a smart remote. I thought it was. There is no Google assistant. Typing everything is really annoying. I am very disappointed for not having Google assistant. And the installation guy from Samsung was such stupid guy. He finished everything in 15 minutes and left after taking 200 rupees for petrol charges from me. He didnt even installed properly. I managed everything like creating samsung account, cable connection and all. Over all I can say Tv is good except the remote controller."

296,3,Fair,This tv didn't have 3.5mm jack audio out. No option to connect external speakers. Only one usb port. No 3.5 mm jack. Unnecessary additional hdmi ports. Worst smart tv remote. Samsung phone app for tv is buggy and sluggish. Only good thing is screen quality.
297,3,Decent product,Picture quality is good
298,3,Nice,So it's been a month we are using this TV. Its sound quality and picture quality both are good. But the Samsung service man was not nice plus he ruined the walls. According to its price this TV is the best.

309,3,Fair,TV is excellent but there is a problem when we are connected to the mobile there are have some smalll issues on the screen and not working perfectly have some late response not matching to the mobile and TV that is the only problem remaina has excellent
310,3,Fair,Display is not working
311,3,Does the job,This product is awesome..but waranty card not available in box..

326,3,Good,"Thread not made to TV body where Table top stand have to fit. Digital audio output toslink fitting provided but cable adapter not given,it should be provided. I am disappointed with this missing items. The sound of the TV is less than it is described online."
327,4,Worth the money,"Go for it  Nice 32 inch tv by our old trusted brand Samsung  Samsung make TV's from CRT edition to now QLED  And then Samsung service any where by their experts was good  On last I want to say if any one want to buy tv remember this points: *Go for a trusted brand who gave good after sale service because this was a tv not a mobile which we donot change after 2 or 3 years. *Check ratings from inside like picture, sound, connectivity. *Check online reviews ,video etc"
328,4,Value-for-money,"Value for money..  Pros: Picture quality and different picture modes. Sound quality is beyond expectations. Have all the necessary apps and you can also download them. Smooth interface, not too much lag.  Cons: Casting: sometimes picture/video doesn't show while casting. Thick besels in 2020.  Overall I would say it's a fantastic product from Samsung. Happy that I didn't buy the cheap Chinese alternatives. Go for it if 32 inch hd ready smart tv is your choice. Loved the product..."

330,4,Good quality product,"Awesome smart tv at this price sound quality and picture is super, connectivity also excellent it have all the smart tv apps just go for it, Best smart tv at this value.And filpkart packing is very good , thank you filpkart for your services."
331,4,Wonderful,"Samsung 32 inch smart tv is a good one to buy. Picture quality is very nice. When you are running via internet, bandwidth is the main priority. High bandwidth you can watch best picture. But i am dissatisfied with the sound. Although it has 20watt rms speakers, but sound is average. Bluetooth is unavailable in this model. I think in low budget its the best tv to buy."
332,4,Nice product,"Review after 2weeks Am already using Mi 4a Pro for last one year, Comparing with Mi 32inch tv #picture clarity Mi is winner #for Audio clarity samsung is winner, really super sound Comming to samsung tv Pros Sound is far better than mi Fast boot and opening is fast - mi tv is delay in boot and switching, app opening User friendly, helpful for old age people Build is super  Cons Thick bizels Cable tv picture is not that good.. use set top box for better results"
333,4,Wonderful,"Good Selection in this price range. Picture quality is decent with good sound system. Connectivity is also very easy to youtube, prime, netflix using a single button on remote. On time delivery by flipkart with installation on next day. Overall, for this price range very good product."
334,4,Good choice,"Look is fine, Good purchase, thanks to Flipkart for a good offer, but took a bit long time to deliver,  Though connectivity though wifi is Good, But found some back locks on the TV - Do not have a Bluetooth connectivity, Do not a have a 3.1 audio out, Sound quality avagage, expected a bit better sound quality from a smart tv, of Samsung Can not install outside apps, other than pre-installed apps, as not expected on smart tv, No smart remote,  Other features Excellent... Thank you Flipkart & Samsung,"
335,4,Pretty good,When u receive it first thing u do.. just update the tv software.. Change the Sound preferences to amplify.. For good picture quality u have to subscribe first HD channels on ur dish..or HD files input required..Normal tv channels burst on screen .. Wireless connectivity is awesome.. Power consumption is a bit high as it's rated 2/5.
336,4,Delightful,Very good 👍 tv
337,4,Delightful,Normally good... I bought it for Rs 12599 via hdfc credit card... But no bluetooth connectivity it is so bad..
338,4,Good quality product,"Good Television For Modern Time ,If You Want It Then Go Nd Buy It ,,,👍"
339,4,Delightful,"Pros: Pricing - It comes at a lower price than even a standard smartphone. Picture - Picture quality is good. However, square pixels are clearly seen if looked closely. Sound - In a nutshell, ""Awesome"". Value for money. Pre-installed apps - It has Hotstar, Netflix, YouTube, etc.and few other similar apps built-in. Just switch on your internet and enjoy.  Cons: Bluetooth - It lacks bluetooth connectivity which I feel is unbelievable. HD Ready only - Resolution is not that great. But keeping the pricing in view, there's nothing much to complain about.  Overall- Good considering all aspects."

0,1,Don't waste your money,Worst product by flip kart
1,1,Terrible product,Rubbish phone just waste of money on brand name
2,1,Absolute rubbish!,"Delivered with faulty charging adapter.

4,1,Not recommended at all,Please don't buy from seller SUPERCOMNET if there is any dislike bottom for purchase experience I will definitely give double dislike belive me friend most horrific experience
5,1,Horrible,Heating problem. It is getting heated even with normal use of internet and gaming.
6,1,Unsatisfactory,No working Face ID
7,2,Expected a better product,"Functionality wise android is much superior. You will miss a lot of useful features like app lock, downloading of your favourite videos or songs after switching to iOS. Network issue is also there. My mi phone had better network reception than this phone. Camera and audio quality are superb in iPhone."
8,2,Not good,The exchange experience was pathetic. With minimal scratches on my iPhone the executive denied taking my phone and gave me a bad value. What was promised was not given for a phone in very good condition.
9,2,Slightly disappointed,Facing sensor issues
10,2,Slightly disappointed,The mobile have problem since I bought it. I have recorded some videos and they don't have sound. So please if you buy it check it the moment you get it in your hand.
11,2,Could be way better,"Some time I have network issues(WIFI is not working), I think this is not new product. they are cheating the people."
12,2,Not good,"Camera is very good and performance is awesome. charging is slow, overall very good mobile at this price range. Xr is my first iPhone."
13,2,Moderate,"Bad rating is not for the phone, phone is good I like it a lot, but for the delay it took Flipkart to deliver. Also the sale price and normal price is same now. Flipkart is just trying to fool people. I will never buy from Flipkart again."
14,2,Could be way better,But product price dropped so much just after my purchase & battery is taking 3 hrs minimum to get fully charged. But other aspects are nice
15,2,Bad quality,The battery is worst. The battery capacity is falling very rapidly and the customer service just resets the phone and gives it to you saying they can’t do anything about it. Now I really regret buying iPhone XR.
16,2,Not good,Battery backup is really bad.I you are switching from android to iphone then it can be a real struggle for you.

38,2,Expected a better product,"I have come to review this product again after almost 6 months of use.

Simply don’t buy. As like other, I have bought it to serve my lifestyle purpose nothing else and I switched this product from one plus 6. Believe me that 1 and a half year old purchase still is better than this product in all aspects:

Performance
Battery life
Touch
Multitasking
Camera
Ease of use
Apps availability

What else not! Just don’t buy... believe me DONT BUY. You are gonna regret your money."
39,2,Bad quality,Earpods were not given with the phone.

50,2,Moderate,Mobile hanging problem
51,2,Bad quality,"High Price but no Fast Charging Facility, you need to spend more money to buy the fast charging cable or adapter, limited features, over rated product, no glass display...not satisfied with the product..."
52,2,Slightly disappointed,I was under the impression that iPhone would be much different from rest of the phones but was disappointed. It is no different. Battery does not last very long. Camera not very powerful. All in all there is nothing great about it. I can’t understand why it is so expensive.
53,2,Could be way better,"The product had immediate battery drain... in just 3 months the battery drained to 92% health.. and display looks cheap like android.. it’s this exclusive product alone, but when I checked in apple they said display and battery is legit and yet I don’t understand. I have another iPhone 11 but that works just fine and infact it’s older than this XR. It’s battery life is at 96%"
54,2,Moderate,Don’t buy anything from Flipkart specially during mahasales period i feel cheated right now after using it just for 3 months now my battery percentage is 99%
55,2,Expected a better product,The phone is having problems continuously. The volume has gone down within 3 months and the battery life is really bad. I feel flipkart sold a duplicate product

58,2,Expected a better product,hanging issue not value for money
59,2,Bad quality,Battery backup not good
60,2,Moderate,"Battery & processing is very low, in shortcut I tell only money waste brand……….."
61,2,Bad quality,"The main issue that I’m facing with this device is that it heates a lot. Sometimes, I have to remove the back cover so that it can cool off. 2nd issue is with the battery, which drains really fast. Other than these I think it’s a pretty good phone."
62,2,Could be way better,"A very average phone and considerably heavy. Made the mistake because I was keen to come to the apple ecosystem thinking safety. Don’t know how true is that. Anyway, deed done and this time when im buying a phone, I’d buy the latest model."
63,2,Could be way better,Average
64,2,Expected a better product,charger and earpod not found

78,5,Simply awesome,super camera quality is wonderfull
79,2,Moderate,The box was not sealed properly
80,2,Expected a better product,Just okay
81,2,Not good,Not worth it...
82,2,not up to mark in 2020,"screen and smoothness is not up to mark in 2020.
Before have it , i used oneplus 6t which is more smother than xr and screen of op 6t was far better than xr .
So it is good for them who want apple logo on the back side.
Ios also not good like android.
For apple user i want to say that first use op flagship phone then compare with xr"
83,2,Moderate,It’s back glass broked in just one dropped very bad build quality
84,2,Expected a better product,Very bad camera quality. Don't know if the problem is only with mine as I found many good reviews

89,2,Bad quality,"Cellular reception is very poor, regular network drops..
Average camera... Front camera is useless.
Battery is decent."
90,2,Could be way better,"I am not satisfied with the product delivered by flipkart, the apple box seal was open, so they can do anything with the product. My mistake was that i had not made the video of product opening. Otherwise not satisfied with product. Suggest all to plz avoid flipkart"
91,2,Not good,Average
92,2,Could be way better,Product is great but the time took for the delivery is pathetic and of course pathetic customer service from Flipkart
93,2,Not good,Not what expected
94,2,Slightly disappointed,Battery charging is too long time and immediately drain is battery camera not High clear
95,2,Moderate,Price is not worthy.
96,2,Could be way better,Good for the price. But heating issue in most apple phones bought online.
97,2,Could be way better,Very Late response
98,2,Could be way better,"I would suggest that you think we'll before purchasing on Flipkart...
It's not even a month and so soon I ve started having issues with the phone.... So verify well"
99,2,Expected a better product,"Pros : brand, sound quality, picture clarity
Cons : poor Network connectivity, less display breadth, poor WiFi connection, poor personal hotspot connection, small keypad due to less width slower typing speed due to spelling mistakes, sometimes poor touch response on top side. I am not sure if everyone face these cons or I got faulty peace :( but disappointed after spending good amount of money"
100,2,Slightly disappointed,Very heavy weight. 190gm. Camera quality is poor.
101,2,Moderate,Earlier was using iPhone 6SE. Now bought iPhone XR after reading the review got in 41k..its looking amazing.. Loved it.. I just want to hold it for life. So smooth working.. Earlier problem was of ringtone which I corrected through goggle help.. Thanks iphone
102,2,Could be way better,Sound system not working
103,2,Could be way better,"Seriously ????? for so much money this phones battery doesnt even last a day, even with one or two call anyways in absence of head phone socket i don't watch videos. Pathetic product."
104,2,Could be way better,"No smooth experience worst phone ever,hotspot doesn’t connect;t work after connecting with apple support as well it didnt help had to go through self help content on YouTube and spend hell lot of time. The iOS is slower than snapdragon processor and battery drains too fast.Its a brand new iPhone and I literally have to charge it thrice in a day. Not at all value for money"
105,2,Expected a better product,"Phone is freezing and lacking before and after update ,touch is not working properly, software glitch , silent key button and volume key button is loose"
106,2,Slightly disappointed,Amazing phone one cons is charging battery is very slow..
107,2,Moderate,Too much scratch on the box
108,2,Moderate,"Camera & Display very poor & not as expected.
If u want iphone better visit nearest shop for comparison b/w other models."
109,2,Moderate,I highly price
110,2,Moderate,"Delivery guy was an idiot behave like owner of flipcart, without any problem they don't exchange old phone, if old phone exchange not happening why flipcart showing exchange your phone, it's very pathetic flipcart don't miss guide costumers."
111,2,Slightly disappointed,"No complaints about performance as well as display
But the battery🤦🏼 , never expected this from apple,I know charging will get slow so i bought 12w adapter and it is charging upto 80% in 1hr(starting 20%) and then boom it will take atleast another hr to charge upto 95%
So mostly I charge upto 80 and use. Even the screentime i am getting with that 80% is not so great i mean , i used MIA1 before ,it has same 3000mah battery and lcd display still last same as iphone xr(5hr at max)
It is consuming min 20% for an hr use ( I didn’t played any games ) with just youtube and amazon prime also
Its consuming a lot of power"
112,2,Could be way better,"Heating problem, hang problem also seen in sending videos."
113,3,Just okay,"Came from One plus family and I didnt like ios at all..
Not for people who want to get work done fast"
114,3,Fair,After 15 days of usage rear camera is good front camera is ok. U wont notice HD display until u consume some media display is noticeably less sharp in youtube videos battery life is good
115,3,Good,If u r going to buy iPhone then go for I phone 11 or upper versions. Performance wise I will say it is not the best phone in the market. The best thing about the iPhone is always it’s hardware. The outer finish is just perfect & it looks really nice.
116,3,Nice,"I’m using iPhone for several years but couple of things I noticed this time. I switched to this device from iPhone 7 and my feedbacks are -

Cons:
- The phone is very heavy and thick even Galaxy A51 is thinner than this
- The NAUTCH, oh my god 😳😳 its too big for that apple did lot of adjustments like battery percentage doesn’t show, bluetooth connected device doesn’t show
- Camera will serve the purpose

I personally don’t like the big phones for me I guess iphone SE or 12 mini would be good.

Pros:
- Performance is too good better than same range latest oneplus
- Display is ips but it’s very good near to Samsung Galaxy A51 super amoled
- Face unlock its too fast. But now days there is a issue for the mask. And it’s really very frustrating to unlock this huge heavy phone in one hand by entering the 6 digits pin 🤦🏻‍♂️
To solve this problem you have to purchase Apple Watch 😂

Flipkart delivery was good."
117,3,Just okay,Everything good but the main dis advantage is that it will get lot of time to get charged as no fast charging option is available
118,3,Never move from Android to iOS,"If you are using a Android flagship, never buy an iPhone - EVER.

I was using Oneplus 7T before this and bought for the iPhone brand coming back to Apple after 10 long years. I was extremely dissappoined.
Cons
- Software is 3-4 generations behind Android in terms of user experience. Too many things difficult to do on iPhone, like even a copy paste selection
- Touch is very difficult to manage. Most times it wont select right alphabets and sometimes touch itself is not sensitive
- Resolution of XR is poor. I feel like going back 7-8 yrs coming from OP7T
- Battery charging is pre historic era. Takes hours and hours. Modern Androids take it to full charge in 100min or less now. I mostly plug by iPhone overnight for charging. One nigth if I forget, I will never be able to full charge by phone - It takes way toooo long. Fast charger spec also doesnt feel like it will improve charging speed much.

Pros
- Camera is good
- Build quality is good
- No lags

Buy iPhone only for the brand show off. NOTHING ELSE"
119,3,Just okay,"I was using one plus 7 before which is way better and cheaper than iPhone XR in every aspect,better display,better performance, better camera and better battery and more storage.i had to buy this phone simply for the Apple Watch otherwise I would have never bought iPhone XR."
120,3,Does the job,Everthing is good but still iphone 7 plus have way more better speakers rather then XR and the camera quality is not very good. Further if you are looking for budge iphone then XR will be the best choice
121,3,Nice,Nice phone (Coral)
122,3,Decent product,Heats up on slight usage. Battery backup is only good when not being used. On continuous usage battery keeps on racing downwards.
123,3,Just okay,Price is high i got in big saving day 128GB 50000/-
124,3,Does the job,"I bought XR 128 gigs red variant with 10 percent HDFC discount. Delivery is slightly took more days. Packing is neat and good. Its recently imported phone. Performance is snappy and clean. Camera is good. Battery life is awesome. I get around 8 plus hour screen on time. Its way too bulky and weighs more. The main problem and serious problem is, it has got reception problem in LTE and WiFI. Signal strength sucks. I am kinda confused what to do. Have done a online research and found its common in XR model, since apple uses inferior intel modems in XR models. The problem is not persistent in XS model since it uses a superior modem. Apple thought XR is a really cheap model in the line so did this trade off which is considered a primary hardware an any smarphone. My oneplus 3 is too good to recieve LTE data whwn i campare both phones side by side. Any help will be appreciated. Thank you."
125,3,Does the job,"UPDATE

Don’t buy from flipkart. I really doubt the quality of phone sold. I am facing so many issues with my phone. The ram management is very poor. It can hardly keep apps in memory. Everytime I open an app in memory, it refreshes again. Also, I face issues with connectivity to wifi. Many times it doesn’t autoconnect to wifi if connection broke in between.

I loved the camera. Only think I don’t like is the time it takes to charge. It takes almost around 2 and half hours to completely charge. I always have to leave the phone on charge at night because during day you hardly get time to charge."
126,3,Fair,"Awesome handset, Camera is great. Battery backup is nice it works whole day in a single charge.
only thing that bothers me is the bezels of this phone, even after this is a full screen phone i has a very thick bezel on all the sides"
127,3,Decent product,"Pretty average, 15k for phone, 25k for brand, I am coming from android background, can tell you for sure iOS is useless when compared to android when it comes to user friendly interface.
- keyboard is nightmare
- sound control is hopeless.
- Bluetooth pairing is headache.
- lack of free apps.
- battery is ok
- only advantage is at any point of time there is no lag in using the phone or switching between apps. This is only +ve I found.

PS: though I did not pay for the phone from my pocket (my company sponsored), I still regret it waste of money and should have gone for some decent android phone."
128,3,Good,Idk why but its battery % jumped from 100 to 96 in 1 day after like 15 days
129,3,Fair,It's price around 42k rupes and looking at his performance not satisfy with it.If you thinking to buy this XR for Gaming or BGMI then don't go for this go for 11 or upper or if you have tight budget then you can buy this also
130,3,Decent product,"Recently after iOS 14 iPhone XR really lagging and heat up highly.
Go for 11."
131,3,Decent product,I don't know if it is a original iPhone... bcz camera is not upto the mark...
132,3,Nice,Camera is not upto mark specially in little dark. Picture is not that available in othet low budget handset.
133,3,Fair,The earphones i got it is not working!
134,3,Fair,Good and average
135,3,Fair,It getting hot after a mild usage
136,3,Just okay,All is good with the phone but battery seems to be draining fast. What ever purchased during the big billion day has a problem. Earlier I had purchased Airpods which also have stopped functioning in an year's time. Hope Flipkart is not getting rid of damaged items on big billion days.

138,3,Decent product,Very good mobile but not taking update.
139,3,Nice,"Very good phone
Value of money"
140,3,Nice,My 1st iPhone and it has been a great experience till now . It’s a price worthy phone 👍🏽
141,3,Just okay,Overall the phone is pretty good but it's 2020 and you're giving people a 5 watt charger to charge their phone which takes almost an eternity for a full charge!
142,3,Good,Late delivery but product is good

145,3,Decent product,"Network issue , lagging,"
146,3,Fair,I think iPhone XR is overrated. A very avarage cameras. It stands nowhere against Oneplus 7 picture quality honestly. I can show 100 pictures I have captured. Rest good looking phone.
147,3,Good,Camera & Battery could have been better.
148,3,Does the job,Hopefully it will work well
149,3,Nice,"I would suggest to avoid basis on my experience. 6 months past purchase, this device hangs and slows down. Comparing to other models used, I think this device is the poorest in terms of performance.
I have never faced an IPhone earlier which has a delayed response time or freezes. This does.
Missing my IPhone 5S , best I have ever used"
150,3,Does the job,Camera quality was not as expected
151,3,Just okay,Don’t buy if u want strong battery backup and gaming otherwise it is amazing for normal use
152,3,Does the job,EarPods not working.... (volume buttons & Mike not working) really I disappointed with this. Kindly support me
153,3,Does the job,now a days android is giving full competition to ios so if you something better than this you can go for it. don't waste on just for brand.
154,3,Just okay,A good purchase
155,3,Good,Overall performance is ok. But the touch screen beside the notch portion is sometime is not responsive. It needs improvement .
156,3,Fair,Never expected such a unfair camera performance... OnePlus is much better than this phone camera... Really disappointed with camera performance.. and still there is no update for camera from Apple
157,3,Does the job,Not good not bad very heavy heat this phone
158,3,Just okay,WiFi is automatically on in morning. I am facing the issue from fast one year
159,3,Fair,It takes 2 hour or 2.5 hours to charge the full battery…camera is also ok type ..all over not worth buying it..👎

1. Screen goes blank intermittently while ringing. You can't see the caller details. Interestingly this is not happening every time.
2.Camera goes off intermittently. While taking photo , it goes to home screen. Called apple care couple of times but they as usual they give escaping answers ."
166,3,Good,It becomes hot whenever I charge it .Sometimes network is also an issue.I am shocked that New Apple I phone has an issue

175,3,Decent product,Quiet heavy
176,3,Good,Camera is average
177,3,Good,"This is the 1st Apple phone I have bought.
Camera, Photo quality and Display is super.
This phone has severe range issue. Call drop because of range is very common. Many a times, only one card has a range while the second card goes ‘out of coverage area’.
Very rarely both cards will show full rage that also for a few moments even when the phone is in full range area.
Battery you have to charge every 12 hours.
Other things are ok.
So, if you want to use your phone for calling and receiving calls, this is not a phone for you."

203,3,Fair,Awesome
204,3,Does the job,Extra ordinary
205,3,Good,"LCD Display Resolution is too bad. Not worth it for the price. In my opinion, Samsung Galaxy NOTE 10 with AMOLED display would be a better alternative."

212,3,Nice,There is an issue with the sensor while on call display gets off. Only some time it's visible.
213,3,Just okay,Battery issues
214,3,Does the job,CAMERA COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER FOR THIS PRICE. LACKS CUSTOMIZATION FEATURES A LOT. AND ALSO RESTRICT USERS FUNCTIONALITY IN MANY WAYS. QUALITY IS GOOD EXCEPT DISPLAY.
215,3,Just okay,Good product but not Handy & battery discharge is faster
216,3,Good,Not perfect according to price.
217,3,Nice,Awesome phone....if u have some more to spend then purchase iPhone12 mini

220,3,Just okay,The camera quality is not great as aspected even the phone half in its price range can click way better photos but performance is excellent no issues about that
221,3,Good,Buying this is okay but who can buy this they can buy 11 too so go for 11 i had to buy both.. 11 has glassy look which is more attractive.

227,3,Decent product,Very bulky
228,3,An OK Product at best,"Received on time. Phone is good, but it has its flaws too

1. Touch isn't as smooth as other IPhone I have (purchased from canada)
2. Signal strength is way too weak. Even my galaxy s9 has better signal strengths(cellular and wifi both) than this
3. Found camera to be not at par with the other Iphone X that I have, seems worse than that.
4. Vibrations aren't as strong as I remember Iphone usually has

Other than that, phone works fine. Not as good as I expected it would be"
229,3,Fair,Excellent battery back up
230,3,Fair,Facebook 360 Photo option not available.
231,3,Good,okay product
232,3,Just okay,Price droped within 2-3 months by 13k

Ear pods clarity is not upto mark.
Camera is okay."
234,3,Decent product,Facing problem if we install 18 d guard on screen screen goes black during call
235,3,Decent product,Ok
236,3,Just okay,"Everything is fine with this phone except one thing. It keeps taking random screenshots. Not sure if it is a software update bug or a device issue. Phone’s overall performance is good, battery life is okay and very impressive camera. But I find this phone a bit bulky."
237,3,Does the job,Powerfull iphone XR in the world 🌍👌🏻
238,3,Nice,Good iPhone
239,3,Does the job,I must say its better buy in the current iphone price . its a complete value for money .. if u aggressively care about camera than go for ip11 .. rest nothing disappoint in the XR . really great phone . and would say Xr White is far better than 11 white . coz i experienced both devices at the same time for 4 month . one more suggestion for SE buyers .. don’t pick it . if u want next level experience at very low at apple then Xr would be right pick not the SE. if u have tight budget then also don’t recommend SE for sure (except if u need a small powerful phone) . instead buy 2nd hand XR n 11 .
240,3,Does the job,Ok type
241,3,Does the job,Average
242,3,Decent product,Awesome product and the fact is Delivery boy was cool.Ekart needs more like him

248,3,Fair,Battery get discharged soon
249,3,Does the job,The product is not a new one it's look like a refurbished handset while opening both box everything was distributed like before itself some opened and used.
250,3,Just okay,Best part it's brand is apple.. That's all but camera quality id very minimal
251,3,Fair,"Thanks flipkart for your speedy delivery !!!

Well my Ratings about this phone is if your using G pay/ Phone Pay means you can use in sim slot number only .Not an E sim The G pay never allows E sim to verify your number this is first draw back.
Secondary Draw back Bsnl Doesn't have E sim Facility ..
Camera clarity Good !! As I told you so many apps missing in apple stores compare to other mobile..
Battery Back up ok !!! But if we use internet one day only battery back up !!!
Using this mobile for more than 1 month everything ok"
252,3,Nice,Not a bad one
253,3,Good,Very bulky...
254,3,Just okay,Product was okay but I didn't get the charge adapter
255,3,Good,Phone is excellent. But the packaging was worst. I have never seen an expensive phone packed in such a ridiculous packaging. The phone was not wrapped in a protective covering. The phone's box bas damaged even from inside. Looks like it was under heavy load. The phone seemed to be fine but who knows if it might have damaged something from inside
256,3,Good,I am facing signal problems while taking voice issues I am not satisfied with the display
257,3,Fair,Still worried about the battery life & health
258,3,Good,"Phone is good in all aspects except network connectivity. The antennas used in this mobile are inferior compared to other iphones. As a whole I can say Apple has cheated his customers. U won't be feeling the problem if there is very good network. I can say this as At the same location, with two sims of same network provider, one in android & another in xr, the internet performed better in android. The android phone I used was OnePlus 7t which is way cheaper than xr."
259,3,Good,Good product with higher price
260,3,Nice,best phone ❤
261,3,Nice,Fraudulent happening in online shopping during exchange of phone at the same time refund takes a month time is horrible
262,3,Nice,Having issues in touch. Sometimes it needed multiple attempts to select something. But otherwise its ok.
263,3,Good,Product is good.. Only issue is that second sim is esim.. Whia is not easily available with network operatiors here
264,3,Good,Not recommended for marketing or field workers.
265,3,Fair,Touch response is very bad......touch did not work many times. Bad experience
266,3,Does the job,Battery draining too fast
267,3,Nice,Ear phones quality not good
268,3,Just okay,"After i purchases the mobile the prices got reduced phone is excellent,camera is superb but this is bit weighs more and also some times it hangs when we answer calls and some times touch gets hangs lets see it gets fix and also battery is good but when you use camera it drains fast but its so good when compare to other iphones
Overall satisfied with the product but i feel the price is bit high"
269,3,Just okay,Phone is good looking but camera quality is not good as expected and lower setting option and battery life is less.It is getting down till evening in normal use on 100% full charge. Working speed of phone is good. Also facing some heating issue during apps running.
270,3,Decent product,Dull sim is natwork probalm
271,3,Fair,2 Scratches at back glass.except that everything is perfect.

Delayed delivery as well."
277,3,Fair,"Writing this review after using it for 4 months.. Overall the product is good. But I’m facing some issues with the sensor..
And sometimes screen is locking itself while using the mobile.
If anyone facing the same issue. Pls let me know how to get rid of it"
278,3,Nice,Good
279,3,Just okay,"For a normal usage this device is good , if u looking for heavy usage like performance and gaming go for iPhone 11 it has 4gb ram as well good processor as well good camera setup than xr"
280,3,Fair,"Performance is Good not excellent as Flipkart app hangs frequently no other app found hang issue, Camera is not upto mark as compared to samsung mid range phones, Display is Good,Battery backup awsome the reason to choose this phone, Bit heavy also.."
281,3,Good,"The replacement of flipkart really is an issue. I dont know what and how that delivery boy picked up a scratch that was also not visible on screen. It was negligible amount of scratch. I really hated the replacement process of flipkart .
The device was genuine . No fraud . Nothing. It was well packed and the performance is great . After all its an iphone."
282,3,Nice,Ok ok hi aa
283,3,Good,Amazing phone by apple
284,3,Nice,"Price i got was 52500 , and now it decreased. Thats why i am unhappy. And camera is not so good. Not various modes are available. But battery backup is awsm. Single charge use for one day. .roughly use. Display quality is good."
285,3,Fair,The phone is good. I am just worried about the quality flipkart has supplied. My phone started to vibrate for no reason without any call or alert. Sometimes the screen gets blank for 5sec. I am unable to show that to service center bcoz when I go there the problem is not visible to them.
286,3,Just okay,Good mobile
287,3,Decent product,Good

295,3,Does the job,Avarage quality pH but size is very good i love to handle this phone
296,3,Does the job,Box seal was broken. But all items was there. Disappointed for broken seal. Or else ok
297,3,good but didn't meet expectations,"Pros:
1.Camera quality
2.premium look
3.IOS
4.Dual sim :eSim + physical sim
5.Face ID works like charm

Cons:
1.disappointed a lot with resolution. S9 has far better resolution
2.For same budge can get lot more in android phones.

Why apple compromising on resolution ? most of users watch videos and play games."
298,3,Does the job,Not satisfied
299,3,Just okay,Good one

301,3,Fair,Product is very good but Exchange policy is tooo worst don't give Exchange
302,3,Does the job,Overall good. Just a touch expensive. Not far behind 11 when it comes to performance. Just few battery issues
303,3,Good,"I bought it for my mom just because she wanted to use iphone for once.
Honestly this phone is very bulky.

I think performance wise and camera wise it's good but I will not recommend this phone for people who are heavy users because battry is again a problem.

I bought it for 35k in flipkart sale so at this price budget if someone wants to try iphone experience u can go for it else I would recommend samsung s series which is far better in features and light weight with fast charging capability"
304,3,Good,Great phone with 36K.
305,3,Does the job,"Previously iPhone I used 6. Was excellent.
But, now XR, Looks like too back dated with thick bezel
Very poor look in 2020 as compared to android"

309,3,Fair,Love it.......
310,3,Good,Great cameras.. That's it
311,3,Nice,"Back up and restore of the data with iPhone xr is very very difficult. I am still struggling to get my contacts and WhatsApp backed up from my old phone & to be restored in my new one. There is no direct iPhone to iPhone switchover possible. It's only through iCloud, which needs a high speed broadband to get things through with it. iPhone still needs to improve on such things."
312,3,Nice,Nice product flipkart customer service is very disappointed
313,3,Fair,Battery drains really fast. Brightness is not that great and have some yellowish tint. Tried display settings also but not much beneficial. Camera is very good and performance is also good
314,3,Does the job,Good
315,3,Good,Side bezels.are more
316,3,Nice,"Average phone with a poor battery life.
Only USP is ios which is also now nothing far better or smoother than android.
Screen is below average when compared to 40k phones of oneplus / samsung.
Battery life is poor and charging speed is very very poor. Pls buy a 20,000 mah power bank alongwith this phone and at least a 12w charging brick.
buying a One+ 8T would be a better choice compared to this overhyped 2 year old phone."
317,3,Decent product,"Received damaged phone, camera glass fell off"
318,3,Does the job,Heating issue
319,3,Decent product,Heating issue is a big concern..about this mob but overall it's a good purchase and when I get this in a best deal in BBS it's a win win deal for me overall and the white colour is look eligent
320,3,Just okay,Good
321,3,Nice,Phone performance is good but this is very bulky.
322,3,Just okay,This my first iPhone and it was awesome truly beautiful device best for gaming best camera’s I totally loved it if you are thinking about it then definitely but it but the worst thing is the battery backup and slow charger which apple provides in the box and that charger wasn’t working which was in the box bye its a beast

346,3,Nice,Battery not long standing
347,3,Nice,so good
348,3,Just okay,"So it's an iPhone, so it's not bad, obviously. But the transition from my Redmi of 10k to this was NOT at all easy as they say. First of all, this doesn't have a dual sim. Well, you can use an eSim as your second sim, but it's not the same. You can't choose which sim you're gonna call from right before the call, like I used to do in my Redmi. You have to assign separate sims for calling and messaging for each contacts, or it'll simply use the last used sim. And to change it is a bit of a tedious process, after so long with my convenient, cheap, Redmi. Also, there's no option for fingerprint. Well, the face ID works well and good, but that's available in my Redmi as well. Also, Face ID doesn't work with Masks on, people. So maybe postpone buying this till Corona subsides. xD But yeah. It's an iPhone."

388,3,Does the job,excellent
389,4,Wonderful,"Let’s keep it simple,
Phone is damn smooth and if you are coming from Android, you will really notice the difference no matter which smartphone you used earlier.
Pros:
1. Camera and image processing (portrait modes)
2. Battery (7hrs screen on time) i.e. all day battery life
3. iOS (If you are coming from Android, you will need 2 days to get used to it.. like gestures and all but once you are into it, there's no way turning back. Animations are refined and you will enjoy them)
4. Face ID is super fast and 100% secure
5. Performance is superior to most Android smartphone in market as of today in this price bracket. A12 it is !!
6. Speakers are excellent
7. Haptic feedback is next level. I can't explain in words.. in short it feels like someone is sitting inside and knocking phone's display 😂😂

Cons:
1. Glass back costs half price of phone itself if in case you end up shattering it
2. Phone is heavy.. 194 grams to be precise and when you add screen guard and back cover, it will add up and finally be around 210~230 grams
3. Battery charging is slow. Like what else will you expect from a 5w charger.
4. Front camera res is 7MP and will give you consistent results for 95% of time but for rest.. be prepared for some horrible selfies 😂

See, if you think that you are ok with a camera performance of 4/5, then blindly go with this phone. And if you are one who has camera as #1 priority then you must go for iPhone 11, it has better cameras.

Pro Tip: Don’t judge it’s display and camera based on just on paper specs and numbers. Both are excellent and 99% people won’t have any problem.
One more thing.. if possible go with a 128 gigs variant. iPhones eat lot of space !!"
390,4,Wonderful,"😍😍 My 1st iPhone and really i love itt....
I moved android to iOS and its very good experience ..
new gui and new things.specially i love 😍 the display..."
391,4,Pretty good,"So amazin....Blue colour is fresh+beautiful+awesome . And For me it's so ooooo pretty & fancy colour . Wow! Phone features , COD tho 👍, price value perfect , full screen wallpaper hd for mobile and about battery life i can't describe . Aaaaaa.......lovely. And im Sorry for my photography but in real blue colour is so amazin , i meant it 🖖."
392,4,Very Good,"After using android for 10 yrs m, i moved to iOS and i must say its very difficult to find n use iPhone...i will come to this later , let me start with features: nice camera but not better than samsung note 8.. display bright n good .. nice sound and very good look... a bit bulky...

What irritates me :

1. Setting ur fav song as ringtone: torture to do that...
2. 90% of good app either wallpaper or ringtones or utility: are paid..
3 iCloud only 5gb..
4. Not able to migrate chrome bookmarks here so far
5. Not sure why select all doesnt work either on msg or whastapp or anywhere
6. Default charger takes arnd 4 hrs to full charge
7. Sound is good n default headset gives good sound

Struggle everywhere for android users...

Last but not least, love to have an iPhone .

Thanks"
393,4,Really Nice,"I received my phone packaged properly and there were no issues with delivery.
Now coming to the phone, I would like to rate it 4 stars.

Camera - Decent camera but there are much better camera out there for the price. This camera is good for 2018 phone but outdated for 2021 phone. If you like to click macro shots of flowers, insects then it might be better to look elsewhere. Landscape and portrait photos are excellent.

Battery - Great battery backup and would easily last a day for an average user or may be a little more. I use 10w ipad charger and it charges the phone to 80% in about 30-35 mins. Phone heats up while fast charging but that’s how it is with most phones

Display - Its LCD, should have been OLED at this price but hey, its not bad by any standards. The touch is something cannot be “copied” by the Chinese phones, its smooth, haptic feedback is great.

Speaker - Good speaker, its loud but bass could have been better. You need high quality audio to play it at full volume otherwise it may produce static. Overall it is satisfactory.

Hardware - A12 chip with 3GB ram works flawlessly even in 2021, there is no lag of any sort while multitasking or using heavy apps although the phone heats a little but nothing alarming. You can play any game of your choice provided you have enough juice in battery.

Should you buy it? Yes, if your priority is brand, build quality, IOS, business usage and you are careful with your gadgets(dropping it might cost you a bomb) then this phone will easily outlast any other android phone in the price range.

And No if your priority is Camera, customisations, very heavy usage, hardcore gamer because there are better phones available with new gen hardware out there."
394,4,Wonderful,"Xr is good but it can be better.

If you ever use phone which have “Amoled” or “Oled” display then you got to know difference otherwise its a great phone with great camera(no night mode and wide angle), performance, and battery( twice charge if you are a phone addict, normal user can get around 2 days without charge).

And also good for people who switch from android recently."
395,4,Very Good,"Looks are great. The UI is really smooth and lag free. Due to absence of useless gimmicky features, its easy to use. Great cameras. Good display. Really a great device. On top of all, Apple assurity!! Updates, stability, virus/malware free."
396,4,Wonderful,Amazing iPhone. Though iphone 11 is the best till now but still this phone can also go for next 3-4 years atleast if you don't need best camera which iphone 11 or 12 has. Got it around 28k in big billion days with exchange offer and bank offer. Worth every penny that too so less as compared to it's actual price. Switched from Iphone 7 which was also nice handy but had battery and heating issues. Except camera which is not that bad everything else is nice!
397,4,Good quality product,"Glad I had bought this phone at 45k before the process went up.
Performance is top notch, the A12 BIONIC chipset is a beast.
Camera is great and HDR kicks in automatically to bring that extra detail in the photos and videos.
Highly recommended."
398,4,Value-for-money,"Now used for almost a week. Performance is great with A12 bionic chip. Almost no lag. Battery lasts for a day with normal usage of online streaming, social media, gaming. Camera is good with great colour accuracy but low light performance is not as expected considering the premium pricing. Overall decent using experience. Blue colour looks cool without case, though one should use case to avoid scratches and glass breaks from unwanted falls. Though 3 gb ram but ram management is excellent. Happy with the product."
399,4,Delightful,Loved the iphone very smooth and boost function and yeah most important stylish and royal when u hold it in ur hands ....Thx
400,4,Nice product,The product is good but seller isn’t good because i had ordered the phone during offer period and after the offer ended seller was telling me to cancel the order from my side and reorder it again I don’t know why which by then price was hiked back to its normal rate. I had to literally wait for one complete month for the product to be delivered that too by contacting customer care like around 7-8 times and requesting them like anything.
401,4,Nice product,"Good phone not bad, felt happy on purchasing with Flipkart, but to get this product for me it takes 10 days to get from the Ekart logistics, please be quick with process intimate customer in a proper way of shipping goods..

Camera _ 4
Performance_4
Battery_4
Display_3
Overall - 4/5"
402,4,Really Nice,"Product is good. Battery backup meets expectation. it has a single camera but, this sensor gives good performance. phone is handy and good looking. So it is almost worth to the money spent."
403,4,Delightful,"The phone was a gift for my father. Apart from being on the heavier side, I didn't find an issue with the phone. The hardware, fit and finish and display are spectacular in every way. My Dad being a music lover claims that this is the best sound quality he had ever experienced on any other mobile device! Price could have better though. I still feel the product is overpriced even though I purchased for 54k after heavy discounts. But as long as my father is happy, all is forgiven! :)"
404,4,Worth the money,When we are getting many features at lowest price ... I don’t feel it’s worth spending more than 55k .... as usual apple products are best in performance and all other aspects except price .... go for it if you can’t use any other mobile other than iPhone
405,4,Really Nice,"Bought this 3 days back and using it heavily.

Charging : Takes 1.30 Hr for a full charging, though apple did little Kanjoosi here, they should have provided the fast charger but anyways its also fine. No issues at all.
Battery: one day usage It’s good I played Pubg for 4 hours straight , surf social sites for 2 hours, you tube 1 hour and other stuff like book reading, wynk and all.. so at the end I was left with 9% battery. So ya its good.
Camera : similar to XS but slo mo is bit shaky. Rest pictures are good.
OS : 12.3.1 I recently got this update and didn’t find any issues with anything yet.
Custom center - when you switch off wifi or Bluetooth it automatically gets on @5 its an OS feature don’t mistake it as a device issue.
Settings: As usual easy to use. Gesture control is good too..
Though I have worked on many mobiles but this one is a beast not because I have this gadget but if you are willing to spend on Samsung note series better to spend here, you would become life time apple fan..

Samsung note series/ Galaxy / One plus 7 pro was in my list but I’m glad that I chose something diff this time, have been a crazy android lover but now I’m a big ios fan too..

I have coral color and it’s nice (: other color variants looks good too (:"
406,4,Wonderful,"Camera is best part of this phone like any other apple phone. Battery is fine. If camera is not an important factor for you consider buying other android phone at this range as they have better battery, storage and other features. Display and performance is top notch. I just heats sometimes been using it for 3 days. Happy with the purchase just a little overpriced i think."
407,4,Value-for-money,"Nothing much to write about this product, great phone. Very quick to use. Some key points

1 - Moving photos from android is a pain, Apple wants to ultimately ensure that you're locked into it's ecosystem.

2 - Battery life is ok, with a reasonable amount of use, it can last for a day.

3 - Camera is great in light, but night photography is where this phone lags ( Guess Apple has nailed night photography finally with iPhone 12 ).

4 - I expect the phone to last about 4 years for me. This phone was launched in 2018, so it should receive updates for the next 3--4 years.

5- Apple phones have a great resale value even if I want to switch later on.

6 - buying an iCloud subscription is a great feature for sharing photos. Default storage of 5 gb doesn't cut it. 50 gigs for Rs. 75 and 200 gigs ( shareable with family) for Rs. 220 might seem pricey, but the peace of mind is worth it.

7 - In the long run, you'll see small nudges from Apple to pay for apps or if you're health conscious, buy an Apple watch. Apple watch integration with health apps is far more superior to that of Fitbit."
408,4,Nice product,"Good iphone in budget to purchase. Feel is totally different from android. U won't get back to android phones after using iPhone. Camera quality is good with good battery back up. Overall a great buy in flipkart BBS at Rs 37,999."
409,4,Very Good,Everything is great about the phone except the display. Feels premium.Camera is good but portrait mode works for Human pic only. Display is like 10k android phone.
410,4,Very Good,I wanted very secure phome in this time when cyber crime is going to upscale. There is no phone in market above 30000 which provide chip level security. ios is more secured than android no doubt. So it was a wise decision from my side to choose iphone xr with decent battery life and every year update i am sure upto 2025. So anybody who think of having a fast phone with security can go with iphone xr
411,4,Value-for-money,"I hope no doubt in Apple product.
it's very great and super. If I talking about Feature so everything is perfect most important thy is your data security. So Apple always fallow up to secure your data, if you compare Android device.
If you want security so no doubt apple is best ."
412,4,Nice product,"Almost used iPhone XR for more than a month now. And overall it’s a great package from apple. Value for money product. Great performance, Great Camera & Display."
413,4,Nice product,Some time there is a network problem. Price is very high as Compared to other phone which is available in market. If ur iPhone lover the u can go for it. It is better then iPhone XS.
414,4,Wonderful,"I am an andriod user & This is my first ios device.Bought Red Color 64GB variant..Color looks rich and premium in hands
I have seen both red and white.. But red looks good and shiny than white.
Loved it.
Pros:
Performance is good
Screen is neither small nor big..its perfect size. I have small hands. I am comfortable using with this
Camera is good, it has many hidden features
No fingerprint but face id is fast even at night
Cons:
camera in indoors and low light is poor..and no night mode
Loading apps is slow and not upto mark, Apps keeps closing with some error"
415,4,Really Nice,"Phone is good for the first time user of iPhone but not for the other iPhone user who thinks its latest version compared to 8plus this will be degraded version of apple , i donno y this one is not even a full hd display? Its lukg lyk below 10k android phones display, no 3d touch is tolerable bcaz i wont use ofter, upgraded were processor which is a sec faster than a previous nd camera even single portrait was fabulous but viewing that image in this display was lukg bit bad if we transfer that to other model lukg great those pics, my conclusion not worth for 70k this is lyk 5c which disappointed me previously."
416,4,Worth the money,The product is amazingly good. I loved it based on my day 1 usage. Camera is definitely the best part of this phone. People who don't want to change thier phone for 2 to 3 years should buy it considering you will get security updates at least till 2023 and the processor is capable enough to work for next 2-3 years easily
417,4,Wonderful,"Switched for the first time to iOS ..it's a different experience altogether as it takes some time to get use to it. Initially it was tough buy after using it for 1month it was Ok. Products hardware and software is good with no lags. Touch is super smooth. Some features are missing if compared to Android which I was using since last 10 years
Overall it's a good experience and I beleive that after using for few more days, it will become more friendly."
418,4,Worth the money,"There's no comment on this phone's performance, look, and value for money.

The best thing about purchasing this phone from Flipkart is that they would call you to check if you get the right product or have any issues. This was the first time I got this kind of call from Flipkart. It's really good customer service and it will build great customer base for sure. Thank you, Flipkart."
419,4,Worth the money,First time Iphone user. Awesome phone. Got it for a reasonable price with earpod and adapter. Good battery backup and no lagging.Product delivered was one year old. Manufacturing date was August 2020
420,4,Wonderful,"Pros
* Good and value for money
* Very nice camera
* Ios is love so no issue on processor and software
* Display size perfect
* Battery enough if used wisely
* Sound output is superb
Cons
* Display is good but not good as compared to other iphones.
If compared side by side then only you will find the difference otherwise its good.
* Low light photo not that good

You can go for it best phone in 38k"
421,4,Very Good,Very good display. In fact best LCD display. Amoled displays cause eye strain but LCD display does not. So people having sensitive eyes should go with LCD displays only. Camera is very good too. Moderate usage gives one full day of battery. Performance is good. May be iPhone 12 performs better than this but for day to day usage this is more than enough. Overall the most value for money iPhone.
422,4,Value-for-money,"Nice I phone this is the first time am using an I phone from android everything was amazing I just love the phone camera ,operating, and audio quality everything was superb ..& I was satisfied this product.."
423,4,Worth the money,"I bought this mobile after some research and I am satisfied with this mobile.
If you are looking for an iPhone under 45000k, then XR is your mobile. Great battery backup ,dual sim, good camera and best performance.. just go for it."
424,4,Wonderful,"The Iphone XR has a great camera, good processor and a very good body finish. But the battery backup isnt yet that great. If you use your phone for normal usage like instagram music WhatsApp it lasts for 6-7 hours at max. Battery drops by 1% every 2-4 minutes. The battery is a big issue when it comes to regular users. Rest all works awesome."
425,4,Really Nice,"What? Nope, I didn't sell my kidney, because I am rich. But not that rich, else would have bought iPhone 11 Pro Max XS Ultra whatever.
So what's good in this phone? People think I am Ok Rich. And it looks like the same iPhone 7 I had earlier. Even same wallpaper.
What's Bad? My living room doesn't have the LG 4K 55"" TV I wanted cos I spend the money on this one.
Should you buy? Yes, else how will Tim Rob Jobs Cooks or any Apple employee will buy the next Tesla? With your money of course."
426,4,Wonderful,"Honest review after extensive use of 1 month.
1. Battery backup is awesome. With internet on whole day and maximal use, battery percentage at end of the day is around 30-40%. This is so far the best battery I have seen in any apple product.
2. Ease of access is also good. Especially the face id makes your locking and unlocking, payment experience smooth and joyful.
3. Sound quality is awesome and with a screen size of 6.1 inch, serves a lot if you're watching a movie.
4. Camera is not up to the mark. Single camera is there, but quality is not very good, at least not at par with other iphones.
5. Only series of apple with dual sim."
427,4,Nice product,"Very nice phone with good durable built and colors, screen quality is also very nice. Everything is perfect about this phone except that it is a little heavier as compared to same segment of phones. Also price is on the upper side when compared to similar segment of phones but i guess that's an apple trademark ;)"
428,4,Nice product,"Display : Good for eyes and strong enough compare to one plus 7t
Camera : Good but not better than one plus 7T

Battery Life : Ofcourse again its performance is poor infront of One Plus battery life and Fast Charger, Apple takes almost more than 3 hour's (unbearable).

Operating system : Android is much better than iOS

Overall Conclusion : Must go for Android Phone in low cost or one Plus without hesitation. For better understanding you can use or operate someone iPhone before taking any decision"
429,4,Worth the money,Nice mobile apps and performance is very good when compared to other China android mobiles in the market. But overall i still prefer android over iOS as it has more customisation . But if you are looking for mobile with great camera and performance then go for it
430,4,Wonderful,"Product is an original one, good and excellent but there are no EarPods and Charging Adapter as mentioned in the product description. So do not believe the description. It a pure marketing strategy. Saying one thing and delivering another thing"
431,4,Delightful,Awesome mobile. Battery backup is amazing comparable to android phones. Display is LCD but far better than android HD + display. Camera is the best thing of the phone.
432,4,Worth the money,"Purchased a month ago in just 33000/-
PROS:
1. 1.5 days battery backup
2. Best camera for capturing HDR pics
3. Premium body
4. Zero lag in multitasking
5. Best speaker/mic for calling
6. Sound at max with deep clarity for music/videos
7. Both SIM (ESIM & Physical) are working fine together
8. Best performance when gaming
9. Quick charging

CONS:
1. Front screen require a guard all the time
2. It is so smooth and slippery
3. Quite big so have issue with holding in one hand


(I will write a review again after 6months)"
433,4,Value-for-money,"I loved it. it's beautiful. There's just this heating problem whenever I turn the hotspot on. Also battery isnt that great. You buy you buy a cover aswell, hella slippery. Audio quality is superb. The charging is slow(obviously) but yeah I used the 18w charger for my vivo, there's a significant loss in charging time. Camera is amazing but I wish there was a little more zoom. Face unlock works 98% of the times."
434,4,Value-for-money,Purchased during big billion day...phone was delivered on time. I'm a first time iPhone user..little time taken to adjust to the changes in UI compared to android. Yet to completely understand the advantages of ios..2 major points...camera image quality is too good and color reproduction is excellent. Battery is good and for normal usage I'm getting for 1.5 days.
435,4,Value-for-money,"Everything is perfectly fine except the display quality and night mode in camera. If there was a amoled display in it and night shot capability, nothing could have been better.

Snuggly performance and butter like smoothness are simply the identity of IOS."

441,4,Very Good,Best mobile go for it blindly
442,4,Worth the money,Amazing pic
443,4,Value-for-money,"Happy to hold and feel iPhone xr.....grt price offered by Flipkart
But am really disappointed to say Flipkart PPL make tempting offer for ur old phone with higher exchange value......but while exchange the delivery guy finds a minute scratch.....very negligible colour fade on the bottom of the phone and he demands the remaining amount to be paid else he will return
I guess we should keep a new unused phone for exchange which should have no scratches or any thing like it
Better to buy in nearby stores even though if it's bit higher in price"
444,4,Value-for-money,Super mobile... I'm completely satisfied buy this mobile...🙂🙂🙂
445,4,Worth the money,I love this nice product
446,4,Really Nice,"Best iPhone for this budget and the last model that company provides original charger and earphones, preferred to buy over iPhone 11 or 12"
447,4,Value-for-money,"It deserves 10/5 but i am giving 4 star just because packaging of product.How can a brand like flipkart pack an expensive product so carelessly but overall product is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥😍obviously it is half bite apple😂😂it is my first iphone thanks flipkart.......

Pubg🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Camera🔥🔥🔥🔥

448,4,Really Nice,Only one word SUPERB.. But price is too high.
449,4,Pretty good,Best Phone I Phone line up
450,4,Really Nice,Value for money. Camera is superb and battery backup is also good
451,4,Really Nice,comfort for handling
452,4,Good choice,It’s best 👍
453,4,Pretty good,Great phone and I loved it. However I feel cheated on the flipkart pricing as you reduced the price from Rs.42000 to Rs.38000 in just 10days since I bought
454,4,Good choice,The product is genuine and services is good but only problem is that the Flipkart shows the high price when we add an exchange phone but when the dilevery boy arrives at home he offers such a low price. This needs to be improved.
455,4,Nice product,Value for money and good battery
456,4,Value-for-money,"Performance and battery life is awesome.
Wouldn’t miss telephoto lense"
457,4,Pretty good,If you just want to hold and use it as a normal phone go for it no issue with camera and screen but it's comes with a 5 watt charger which takes around 2 hours to charge that small battery battery drains faster if u are into some online games u have to purchase a fast charger for that doesn't come with a fingerprint that makes it little boring to use you can get a better android device for this money If you are a android user and thinking of shifting to iOS don't do it you will thank me later .
458,4,Pretty good,"I am delighted with delivery provided by flipkart .I am satisfied with iphone XR ,it's overall performance is good but I am sad to say I have to pay for headset and charger separately as that is not included in the box"
459,4,Good quality product,Received! The Beast! Earpods and adapter was Unfortunatley inside the box!
460,4,Worth the money,Very good product from apple
461,4,Really Nice,fabulous it's too good display is just like crazy lcd
462,4,MRP is lower then the website showing.,"I just got my new iphone but its price is different rather then mentioned in the page.
The price got overnight from 49000 to 52500."
463,4,Really Nice,Good phone except display.
464,4,Worth the money,It doesn't come with charger adapter and earphone . Only cable?
465,4,Good quality product,I can't receive earphone and adopter
466,4,Delightful,Nyc
467,4,Wonderful,This is my first iPhone. I am very Happy This is value for money in 2021 all time good screen and feature.. Must buy it ❤❤❤
468,4,Value-for-money,Good performance but battery is draining quickly
469,4,Wonderful,Average
470,4,Value-for-money,Display and sound is great... if you are upgrading from android at initial stage you will find some difficulty but later on you will enjoy the iOS and one more thing your WhatsApp data will be lost on moving from android but the main issue is with charger you will get a normal usb to lighting cable and a 5w charger which charge the phone very slow. The phone is capable of fast charging but you have to a buy fast adapter and a type-c to lighting cable which will cost you approx 3k if you will go with apple original... so before upgrading take time and think
471,4,Really Nice,I’m loving it 😍
472,4,Wonderful,Fully satisfied. Good one. Camera quality and performance is also good. Don’t think twice. Just go for it.
473,4,Really Nice,"Awesome performance, value for money"
474,4,Worth the money,Product wise everything fine from Flipkart..but coming to delivery service worst experience i have faced..better to improve your delivery services Flipkart
475,4,Nice product,"1 week usage review .I got this in big billion for 38K. I upgraded from iPhone7.
Battery backup is awesome, camera is good(night mode, ultra wide and potrait for objects or pets not there).
Display is good.
i only faced issue is when i switch on the internet from eSim and again switch back to physical sim the internet stops working, u have to restart the phone."
476,4,Pretty good,"Received Black 128 GB two days ago, replacement clause withdrawn by seller. Very poor packing by seller.
The phone is a very good, specs are awesome. Shifted from android to iOS so getting used to. Camera and battery power is very good.
Recommend to go for it."
477,4,Pretty good,Go for it
478,4,Wonderful,1st time using iphone and i love it. I gave 5* to the phone but i’m disappointed that it didn’t comes with the bubble wrap.
479,4,Good choice,superb and cool product.
480,4,Pretty good,"Outstanding images in daylight.
Battery is far better than se and iphone 7 and 8 plus. It is similar to iphone 11.
Performance is op. No lag in Pubg and COD.
Don’t go for iPhone 11. It will give you same satisfaction."
481,4,Very Good,Superbb mobile in this year 💕💕💕
482,4,Worth the money,"Guys phone is fine but don’t buy mobile phones from flipkart. I asked them to pay through my credit card but at the time of delivery the swiping machine didn’t work. I had words with flipkart executive but he asked me to cancel the order. I had to pay the whole amount in cash.
Also i didn’t get “lightning connector” as it was mentioned on the box but still it was not it inside the box."
483,4,Delightful,"As good as iphone 11. If you are not too fussy about dual cameras, you can go for this one and save about 10k. Super performance as always. Camera is great. Both front and rear."
484,4,Very Good,"Value for money
I was skeptic about switching to iOS from android but after getting used to it now I can’t go back to android."
485,4,Value-for-money,Charge was very late better to purchase 20W fast charger
486,4,Good quality product,Good phone but it is weighted ..battery backup is very nice..
487,4,Really Nice,"Camera quality is not so good. Expected better

Good performing daily drive that you can depend on even in 2021 and i guess this would be sufficient for 2022 & 23.

35,5,Worth every penny,"Previously I was using one plus 3t it was a great phone
And then I decided to upgrade I am stuck between Samsung s10 plus or iPhone 11
I have seen the specs and everything were good except the display it’s somewhere between 720-1080 and it’s not even an amoled it’s an LCD display
But I decided to go with iPhone because I have never used an IOS device I have Been an android user from the past 9 years I ordered IPhone 11 (128gb) product red

37,5,Great product,"Amazing Powerful and Durable Gadget.

I’m am very happy with the camera picture quality, Amazing face id unlocked in dark room, Strong battery with perfect screen size as you can carry easily in pocket. This is my third iPhone.

I shifted from android Samsung Note series to iPhone because of the strong build quality and peace of mind for next 3-4 years.

Don’t think to much just go for it and I suggest you to go for minimum 128gb variant or more 256gb.

38,4,Good choice,So far it’s been an AMAZING experience coming back to iOS after nearly a decade but it’s not as versatile as android though phone is sturdy dropped it accidentally a couple of times and nothing happened fortunately camera is awesome
39,5,Highly recommended,What a camera .....just awesome ..you can feel this iPhone just awesome . Good for gaming also ...try pubg in hd it’s just wow
40,5,Worth every penny,"i11 is worthy to buy, too much happy with the product. Thank u flipkart I received the item on time..loved it.."
41,5,Highly recommended,"iphone 11 is a very good phone to buy only if you can compromise for the display. The display on this is device is pretty good but you can get other options with better displays in this price segment.
If you can survive with an HD+ LCD panel with thicker bezels and a notch up top then this is a very good phone for you.
Cameras are awesome, battery backup excellent, great performance and a decent premium look. Good job Apple !"
42,5,Perfect product!,It’s a must buy who is looking for an upgrade from previous generation of iPhones. If you are using XR then still you can hold on for sometime and upgrade to 2020 model else this phone is a must buy . Camera quality is amazing and wide angle is something to count upon. Performance wise it’s amazing and feels premium while holding in hand. So a big YES for this device. Go for 128 GB variant as the 4K videos will occupy lots of space and the storage can get over very quickly. Try to buy it within some offer to get the best value for money.
43,5,Perfect product!,"Value for money❤️❤️
Its awesome mobile phone in the world ...
Display was very good and bright ..
Trust me freinds you r never regret after Buying..
Just go for it....
I love this phone and i switch to iphone x to 11"

46,5,Highly recommended,"It's my first time to use iOS phone and I am loving my upgradation 😍😍 I love the color, I love the assebility of the phone....I need to learn more about its functionality, but as far as I have seen, it's quite easy and it has a lot of functions to work on, specially if you are a content writer or a blogger you get a lot of content creation platforms and they are really amazing.

This phone not only for good quality photography but a lot of other task too.😍💯"
47,5,Worth every penny,"Best budget Iphone till date ❤️ go for it guys without second thought. Let me explain you guys about Camera, Display, battery, and performance.

Camera: at this price range there is no comparison of camera, you’ll love the picture quality as well as video quality. I am a Vlogger I wanted an iPhone with 4k video by front camera and I got this phone and I am more than happy 😃

Battery: I use this phone roughly as I am active social media person and I have a youtube channel. so the battery backup of this phone is far far better than Iphone x and I charge this phone once in a day despite of using this roughly.


Display: don’t go on negative reviews about display. Earlier, I was using Iphone X since 1 n half years. I didn’t see any major difference in display. The display quality is superb as it’s Apple device. You can compare one plus amoled display with Iphone 11 display you’ll get to know that Iphone 11 display is much better.


Performance: the performance of this phone as same as Iphone 11 pro, there is 3 difference between Iphone 11 pro and Iphone 11. First is display, second you’ll get ultra wide angle camera in iphone 11 pro, and third is display Resolution. Except these things there is no difference and performance remains the same.

When you’ll hold this phone you’ll feel that you are holding a premium device ❤️

Like if my review helps."
48,5,Simply awesome,"Excellent camera, good performance, no lag. The lcd display is also good.. but difference come when we watch movie in prime and Netflix, the colours are not vibrant.. as we see in amoled display.. and the charger in box is of 5 watts.. takes more than 3 hours to charge from 0 to 100.. so guys be prepare to buy 18 watts charger . Finally I am an android user, it was my first Iapple phone, I promise u guys the iOS is so smooth.. overall the phone is damn good.... close eyes to buy it.. thanks to Flipkart to deliver this amazing genuine product on time.. at last the iPhone 11 make me smile"
49,5,Worth every penny,"Smooth like butter, camera like fantabulous, sound is crystal clear & its red color is damn attractive, i am just loving it. Must buy if you love photography.

Lucky to get it in sale, thank you Flipkart."
50,5,Worth every penny,"It’s been almost a month since I have been using this phone. I upgraded from an iPhone 8. The main issue with my 8 was battery and this phone is just awesome when it comes to battery. It lasts a day and a half for me with my regular use , internet connected always with 4g
Can’t move forward without saying this. Battery of this phone is a life saver when I am traveling or at work when I don’t get the option to charge
Camera is superb. Front cam selfies and back cam photos are just awesome.
Since i came from the smaller phone category which was an iPhone 8 , I found it difficult to adjust first with the size of this phone, but after the days of usage, I got very much used to it.
Watching a video or reading online is awesome with this bigger screen.
I am very much happy with this upgrade
I am adding few photos I have clicked. Night photography is awesome
The pic in which the guy is stading was clicked at midnight 1."
51,5,Wonderful,This is my first ever I phone. Before this I was using my google nexus 5. But moving from android to iOS is a great experience. It’s worth at this price. I will highly recommend it if you want to move to iOS. The best part of this phone is it’s camera and it’s battery life. This two things have won my heart. I loved it. Happy to have it in my hand. Still exploring its features. And can’t forget to mention Flipkart service. Very prompt service and fast delivery.
52,5,Terrific,Really worth of money. i just love it. It is the best phone ever.
53,4,Nice product,"Awesome Phone. Slightly high price but worth. Better than iPhone XR.
Camera is superb and wide angle camera is very clear.
12MP selfie camera is also very good.
A13 Chip gives a very good and smooth performance."
54,5,Perfect product!,"Battery backup is extraordinary, camera is decent & performance offered by A13 bionic is awsome. The display is good in practical usage like the visibility of display is very good in direct sun light compare to pro models. Iam extremely satisfied for the money I spent."
55,5,Classy product,"Superb Product !!!
A big and worthy upgrade from mi 3S to iphone 11 .
Totally loved it !"
56,5,Brilliant,"I have migrated from OP 7pro... and trust me, iPhone 11 is totally worth it.. following are the reasons:-
1)there is ABSOLUTELY NO ISSUE WITH THE DISPLAY... its crisp, sharp and I found it to be much much better than OP7 pro. Netflix, Prime video all run crisply... you won’t miss a thing. True Tone works flawlessly...the display brightness is perfect. OP have not calibrated their screens properly.
2) iPhone 11 series have really good cameras... others have spoken in depth about them.
3) battery back up is fabulous
4) Screen is FLAT... Hence no accidental touches
5) ABUNDANCE OF ACCESSORY products like TEMPERED SCREEN PROTECTORS, back covers. Best is Spigen.
6) Phone is going to be updated for next 3 years at least.
7) the Face ID works fast.
8) All apps are designed better for iPhones.
9) the Phone is beautiful and people will notice."

Clean box 📦 good 👍 delivery 👌 fast delivery
Original box Original iphone 📱 👌 😍😍😍"
58,5,Must buy!,"It’s an amazing product from apple and the camera is simply superb. Phone is faster.Night shot is simply superb and detailing and colour differentiation from camera is an added advantage

This review I have written from iPhone 11 only and I am glad to say outside.

Cons wise if we see HD+ display only, no battery percentage indicator as in older iPhone 8.
No assistive touch control button in it
No oleophobic coating on back panel glass and finger prints are visible but since I bought mint green colour I felt lucky as it won’t be visible."
59,5,Wonderful,"I just directly switch from iphone 6s to iphone 11 .The best premium smartphone I recommend to everyone. Excellent quality and colors the iphone have in 11 series.
Camera quality is just awesome and the major feel when we hold in our hands. The sound quality and volume is also higher then the previous models.
I will recommend to buy iphone 11 instead of pro models , there is nothing much difference as this model contains everything which fulfill our needs.

Only one thing that I dislike about Apple that it should give fast charger for this price of the iphone"
60,5,Perfect product!,After 1 month use I found camera quality best compared to my previous Samsung note 10+.Display not good as note 10 also charging too slow.Apple should add fast charger like 11 plus and pro.Best phone for daily use

62,5,Terrific purchase,Upgraded from iphone 6 to 11 best phone for iphone users battery is much better than other iphones camera is awesome love to use it.camera is so clear in night.
63,5,Great product,"Well you all know the specifications . One of a kind. Best iPhone till date. Many enhancements to the camera app with many options. Love the glass body with matte finish in the lens area on the back. Lovely colours to choose from. Best battery in an iPhone till date, enough to last more than a day in normal usage. I tested my iPhone 11 battery and lasted for than 24 hours after full charge still with 30% battery charge left. Watched movies for some time. Normal usage on calls, browsing, music , connected to WiFi most of the time, even Bluetooth is on the entire time as it is connected to my Apple Watch series 5. Love the True Tone display option . Voice control option is cool where in you can control your iPhone via voice even offline. I recommend it."
64,5,Terrific purchase,"The built quality is not very premium.
The battery back is great .
The LCD panel is not so sharp but the brightness level is very High .
Camera is super duper awesome.
The red colour which people think is bright is actually very soothing and excellent colour to choose from .
The A13 Bionic chip is really a flagship processor and can beat any phone which even has 12 gb ram .
Camera module is very great and looks very stylish."
65,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"This will help you more. See if you are planning to buy iPhone 11. I will say. Yes. But there are some plans I just want to disclose before you buy. 1) If you are an existing iPhone X/XS/XS Max/ XR user, better you guys do not think it to buy. You guys have more or less better gadget. 2) If you are an android user and planning to buy premium phone. I will suggest them to please buy iPhone instead of buying an Android. I bet you will never go back to android after using IOS. Now I want to share my 1 week experience with iPhone 11. 1) Battery backup is 19 hours as I used it for 1 week. 2) Mind blowing Camera. Best is slow motion. 3) Very Handy. And look premium. If you have huge money then please go for Pro max. 4) Display is more or less good. Worth it because it is not Premium display and you are not paying for 11 Pro max. 5) You will love the sound when your phone is ringing. 6) Front camera is awesome and must try slow motion selfie. That's it. Should provide Fast Charging."

69,1,Very poor,"Reviewing again after 5 months. At the beginning the battery and performance was good but it degraded soon. Also I was facing heating issues. The mobile will heat up like a stove sometimes. You cannot even play Pubg even in low settings properly, performance is not a problem but heating is. Also if you play that game for 10 mins the brightness will be automatically down due to over heating even when the auto brightness is set to off. This will not be solved even if u manually increase the brightness. Cameras are the only saving grace. But for this cost it's not worth it. Finally not good for playing games like PubG."
70,5,Classy product,"We are on apple ecosystem for almost eight years now with couple of iPads and iPhones, including Xr.

Bought iPhone 11 as a gift to my daughter who loves it. We chose for a purple coloured one. Believe me it is gorgeous and towards the lighter shade. Dazzling and brilliant!

The phone is great and does excellent RAM management like any other Apple device.

The screen, though a LCD and lesser ppi as compared to other flagship phones of competitor brands, is a delight to watch with perfect refresh rate.

The phone has a great battery life, even more than the iPhone Xr . With ios 14.4.2, its a brilliant and super fast device. Even the camera is a decent upgrade in addition to the A13 Bionic (7nm+) chipset makes it extremely efficient device.

The battery easily takes you through the day and charges reasonably fast. No 15 W charger or charging cord. You have to buy one.

Unless you have a fancy of buying the latest iPhone 12, iPhone 11 is a perfect value for money.

Flipkart service is as usual great and dependable

Battery enough for 1 day even 24*7 Internet will be on and mostly internet usage

Camera is just awesome cool , android 64 MP is equal to this just 12 MP

A13 Bionic chip will give more high performance without hanging

Audio stereo speakers will give Dolby atoms sound with crystal clear

Video recording is like cinematic shots of every sec can be a 4K 60fps. Just awesome this phone
iPhone 11 loved one"
82,5,Must buy!,"Best Apple iPhone that i have bought at a very reasonable price, camera quality is next level just awesome n of superior quality android phones not even close(RIP) to that and also battery is really good but packaging by Flipkart of iPhone was very poor of such a expensive product, firstly im bit worried about the quality of product if i purchased it through online how was the product but i think now this was mine best decision to bought it through Flipkart online because i got genuine Apple iPhone 11 at a very reasonable price. One advice, just improve your local ekart delivery service and have some regulations over them, and at the end i want to say, fully WORTH! Buying go for it without any single doubt “Must Recommended in 2021 even“ so far so good"
83,5,Fabulous!,"I can say I'm damn impressed with iPhone 11. As they says iPhone 11 have the toughest glass ever in the smartphone which you'll find on the front and back and it's totally smooth. The fit and finish is full apple quality - there's no sense that any cheaping out has happened in the construction. Without saying it's camera features this review won't complete. The iPhone 11 has a dual camera system, consisting of a wide angle len's that's pretty much same as found on the iPhone XR last year, but now with an ultra wide angle lens to back it up great for landscapes, indoor shots, groups and architecture. It also helps with new night mode feature, which captures extremely low light images and small revolution. The rich HDR brings brilliant drama to your photos. On the front you've got an improved selfie camera that now wider field of view, though you can choose how wide you want it to be, narrow for just yourself or wide for a group."

85,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"First thanks to Flipkart for this amazing deal and phone is outstanding. I upgraded from iPhone 7 and this is like very big upgrade. But the packaging was very basic I expected a good packaging as they only wrapped one layer of bubble wrap which I don’t think is enough to protect this expensive phone. And I recommend this phone and seller as well.

And I’m posting this review after using it for 4 days."
86,5,Wonderful,"Superfast delivery by Flipkart. Thanks.

1. iPhone 11 is a pretty solid phone for the money you are paying.
2. All the bad reviews about the display is confusing. It’s not that bad.
3. I switched from a Oneplus 7t. I have no complaints about the display quality of iPhone. Yes, it’s not OLED, so, we are missing on the deep blacks. But that’s it. It is a very colour accurate display. Gets adequately bright and I could not find any pixelation.
4. Performance is one of the best, if not best, in any any phone in 2019.
5. Nice cameras, solid battery life.

If you are looking for a phone in this budget, it’s the best bet for most of the people."
87,5,Must buy!,"I rate this product 5* as it has got amazing user experience with the best performing A13 bionic processor. The screen responds and graphics rendering is top notch. With casual gaming and internet browsing, the battery lasts for approx. 1 day. Camera is very good. You will fall in love with the portrait mode. You can call me a loyal Apple customer or whatever but I won’t stop praising the products and overall experience. That user experience matters and is worth every penny you pay.

Below are the ratings based on my 2 weeks of use.
Processor - 5/5
Screen - 4/5
Camera - 4/5
Battery - 5/5
Design - 5/5
Overall experience - 5/5


I rate flipkart 1* for the poor support."
88,5,Great product,Again back to apple iphone after a gap of 2-3 years. It's pleasure to use iOS and the quality product by Apple. Iphone 11 still works like a beast in 2021 also. It really capable of doing day to day usage as well as hard core gaming. Battery is awesome. I'm really too much satisfied with it. Apart fto the very gorgious IPS LCD (AMOLED will be better) everything is mind boggling. Iphone💕.
89,4,Very Good,"impressive super phone and best in class camera ,sound and face unlock is super fast just see and phone is unlock and fast in daily apps use"
90,5,Classy product,"Well while switching from android to iOS the first thing you need to be careful about is that you will loose all your whatsapp chat backups as both are different operating systems. Camera clarity is awesome and though being an lcd screen clarity and resolution is good. Battery backup is also good unlike previous gen iPhone. So far the experience is good will Padre after a few months of usage.

P.S the black is more of a dark grey shade and not jet black"
91,5,Perfect product!,"In love with this iphone great performance,camera ,battery everything. Go for it have a uncompareble battery backup, no doubts in iPhone camera here You can see the picture which is shot on my iPhone In love with this iphone great performance,camera ,battery everything.

92,5,Just wow!,Best in class. Battery backup is good especially when you play games like Pubg COD. But it is sort of heavy when you hold in hands. Portrait mode is best to click pictures. Stage light effect is awesome. Try to click photos outside in nature because photos inside home or room will not give you the quality in any phone even in DSLR.
93,5,Awesome,Very excited to have this phone. This phone has the real power unlike the android phones having SD 855 . The battery life is very good and the camera quality is excellent as comapred to redmi and other phones except google pixel. I M enjoying every single bit of it. Would recommed only if you have the budget.
94,4,Pretty good,"I was using Iphone 6s and also Oneplus 6t. Both mobiles were perfectly alright in Photos, gaming, and smooth interface . My 6s mobile getting battery issue. thought upgrade to 11. Really like this mobile of its Internal storage (compare to 6s) , camera and its touch feeling. Its a worth buying mobile for me."
95,5,Terrific purchase,Its Very awesome product working and good camera quality and all about best product and also flipkart is very great deal and offer nice price
96,5,Awesome,"I am using this phone for 5 days and its one of the best camera out there ❤️ the screen is not oled and i am coming from iphone xs so its little bit not up to the mark i would say
But overall value for money💕😍the battery back up is far better than my iphone xs and its worth in my apple ecosystem💫❤️if u are an apple User and have the eco system then go for it❤️though i will be getting the new iphone but its pretty good💫"
97,5,Classy product,Best and amazing product.....phone looks so premium.... battary is also good as expected .... Wide angle camera is so addictive ...if you are a IOS lover....then this phone will be the best choice for you all!!💯🔥
98,5,Brilliant,Excellent camera and display touching very nice and smooth very improvement against iPhone XR and new processor is very fast
99,5,Terrific,"I got this beast today. And I must say the picture quality of its camera is awesome. Both the cameras works fine.

As for as the processing is concerned, it runs without any lag. You can play and do whatever you want without a glitch.

The battery runs for a day with medium and high workload.

The display is good and the speakers are working fine.

The earphones doesn't have any base and you can use it for calling mostly.

The charging time is approximately for 90 minutes for full charging.
Hope you enjoy by review."
100,5,Perfect product!,"Awesome purchase. Amazing phone with good battery backup. It’s a top notch device. White colour looks amazing. Phone has a few extra feature than iPhone XR. Overall, this is value for money"
101,5,Awesome,"Always love the apple products, upgraded from old iPhone 6S plus to this after having my first baby. I just love to click baby’s photos with it. Overall I just love this phone. Battery back up is okay, sound quality is good. Haven’t tested yet waterproof yet. Only one thing I hate is apple could have given charger & headphones in box."
102,5,Perfect product!,"Value for money
5 star rating
Excellent camera
Battery backup full day in single charge.

Tougher and water resistant design, glossy back.
The screen has excellent brightness and contrast.
Apple A13 Bionic is the fastest smartphone chip on the planet.
Excellent battery life, fast charging support.
Stereo speakers with great quality."
103,1,Very poor,"Please DONT buy from here,

I purchased Apple iPhone 11. with an exchange of IPhone 7, the exchange did not go well, iPhone 7 had a small scratch out side screen which i could never identify till date, but the FLIPKART person could, so he reduced 50% from exchange rate. I decided not to trade in, but paid money.

iPhone 11 Detail Below
---------------------------------------------
It came with no charging, then i have put for charging, it took lot of time for charging, the phone also showed some heat during charging.

Later i could make 1 normal call and 1 facetime call. Installed my apps, then, I switched off the phone yesterday night(5/26/2021) with charging at 90%.
Today morning (5/27/2021) i tried to switch it on and it NEVER SWITCHED ON.

I contacted the APPLE SUPPORT, they shared some tips to switch on, but it NEVER SWITCHED ON.

Later they suggested me to put it for 1 hour charging and check if it switches ON.

Unfortunately it did not switch ON.

Now i cant return the product back to flipkart as they are redirecting me to apple support.

Apple support due to lock down, gave a slot for Saturday 5/29/2021 to approach the service center Conquer in hyderabad.

They will run a diagnostic it seems, if they found defective, and have a ready new piece they would replace.

So for now fingers crossed, hoping i will get a new piece.

FLIPKART is not ready to replace and we need to go this route of brand support only.

Very Very Bad experience, We were using iPhone from 2013 and till now did not face such experience. We had Iphone 5, 6S, 7, 8 in the past and now moved to 11 which gave a worst experience."
104,5,Fabulous!,"awesome phone to have. it has got many smart features apart from mind blowing looks, camera, display, battery and sound. have fallen in love with this phone. must buy phone if you have got enough money. thanks to flipkart and apple of course.."

Camera is excellent, especially the nightmode
Display perfect
Battery backup awesome
Sound quality very good
Overall Apple gives you a perfect iphone in this range.
Really in love with iPhone 11"
118,1,Worthless,"Phone is awesome no doubt. But Camera & Display is not great. Performance is mind blowing.
But the phone is heating too much when charging or when you regularly used. It's experience after using 1 week. It's heating extrem when I play PUBG for 30 minutes.
Go for iPhone 11 pro or 12. Otherwise go for Android phone you will get much better phone in less price."
119,5,Super!,"Did an upgrade from 6s plus to iphone 11.
Ao far the experience is well and good. Felt smoother than 6s plus. The camera quality is superb. Battery backup is descent. Not a heavy user, and gets power more than a day. Go for it if you need an alrounder iphone in a competitve price."
120,5,Excellent,"It was amazing experience for me. Honestly i am using iPhone first time so I don't have that much past experience about that. But after using 7 days this mobile i want to give some honest feedback.
1- Display 9 out of 10

3- Battery 7 out of 10
4- Performance 9.5 out of 10

I will highly recommend you guys if you have budget then you can go for this mobile.☺️☺️☺️☺️"
121,5,Wonderful,Super and marvellous phone look very cute and nice sound. I love this phone i think white is good colur.Excellent camer 5*😍😘♥️♥️
122,4,Nice product,"If you are looking for a premium phone under 55k, this is the one for you.Got the iPhone 11 during the Republic day sale. Performance is top notch in this price range. Camera's do a perfect job in taking good quality photos and videos. Battery backup too is satisfactory. Writing this review after using for a week. Any further observations would be updated."

124,5,Classy product,Gifted my man on his 30th birthday 🎂 He loves it.. Him happy so i am more than happy 😍😘❤️🥰
125,5,Terrific,"I bought iPhone 11 On March 2021, And I am Writing this review after using the phone for 4 Months. I would Say Everything is fine, Top Performance, Nice Camera as Anyone would Expect from any series of iPhone but when the Question comes to Battery it is complicated. The Battery is fully optimised and it comes 3110 mAh capacity but the problem is with the charger. Honestly Apple Removed charger from in Box items in the name of Environment and they are also forcing us to buy any 20W PD 3rd party Adapter or an Apple original charging adapter separately along with the phone. And the worst part i buy this fast charging adapter cause i need to and my Maximum battery capacity decreased from 100%-97% after charging full for last 3 months. Hence, Fast charger really Affects the Lithium-ion battery inside it. i would say if you are buying an iPhone 11 or later series go for it but do not give the phone a Full 100% Battery Charge every time with the fast charging Adapter. If you have an old iPhone 5w adapter you can use that, the phone will take approx 2 - 3 hours to Charge but it will Affect you battery Life very less and keep up the Longevity of the battery. With 20w Fast charging Adapter your battery will juice up in just 60mins but beware of giving it a full charge. It really will affect the battery life of your phone drastically. To check your Battery Health go to Settings>battery>battery health. Do try to plug out your charger when it reaches 95% to 98% thats enough and will keep your battery healthy. Overall the phone is perfect and power packed!! Go for it!"
126,5,Excellent,"Just go for it.
This phone is really amazing. I ordered it for my wife and we click photos on this thing which are better than dslr. I own OnePlus 6t but it's camera sucks. iPhone is really amazing when it comes to camera. It's worth spending 50k on this. Cons- only display is lcd. While using u don't feel it but if u compare with other phone then u can see difference quite easily.
Changing from Android to iphone is bit difficult coz most of things u don't know but I liked it. Some of the apple only apps are amazing. This thing gives u built in compass, task and video editing apps which are quite useful."
127,5,Fabulous!,Everything is perfect pictures come out so clearly and at first I wasn’t sure when I got it then when I started to use it and get the hang of it it was amazing!! I can’t wait to see what the next future phones will be like. The screen display on this bad boy are unbelievable they are so clear and never fail me. The performance is super cool there is a lot of cool features as well I like this phone because I feel that it is easy to use and one of my favorite things about this phone is the Face ID!! It is just remarkable and easy to get into my phone instead of doing the whole password which sometimes takes ages!! Overall I think this is the best phone yet to be built!! I used to have a really old phone like the iPhone 6s which is a big step up. This iPhone 6s wasn’t the best at taking pictures
128,4,Pretty good,"I've used this phone for over a month now and here are my takeaways.
I would like to first talk about the best things about this phone and then the cons of it.

Pros:
This phone is a performance beast. It handles large games and applications effortlessly and you won't find any stutters or lags while playing graphic intensive games like pubg, cod , mortal kombat and asphalt.

This phone has only 4gb ram and yet the ram management is amazing, it can keep 3 heavy games in memory without reloading them. If you are a simple user ,you can happily forget about closing the applications. Having simple applications like facebook, insta , whatsapp open will not affect the performance of this phone.

The build quality is amazing , as it comes with back glass panel , a case is always recommended , else at the end of the day you'll find your phone with your fingerprints all over the back.

Camera is great on this phone, the 12mp shooter takes good photos which looks more natural , It doesn't boost the colors like samsung which can be a disappointment for few people.

This phone comes with stereo speakers and they are loud.

This device comes in cool colors .

It's battery life is good , an average user gets upto 12 hours and a heavy user has to charge their phone after 5-6 hours.

Face unlock is very accurate and works greatly even in low light.

Cons :

This phone comes with an LCD panel which is a big let down to many users, mainly those who switch from AMOLED. The screen is 6.1 and the pixel density is 326ppi, so while playing high graphic games you can easily spot the pixels . Also at 45k you will be getting a screen which is just 720p , though apple boasts it as retina display, it is no match to a full hd amoled screen .

This phone doesn't come with a power adapter , you need to buy it seperately at 2k if you want to fast charge this device. (18watt fast charging available) , it takes close to 2 hours of you use the 5watt adapter.

No headphone jack (though it became a routine now a days) , no lightning to 3.5mm adapter in the box and there is no dolby Atmos support for this device.

While the apple OS is slick, there's no customisation .

Verdict : I switched from an Android device to iOS , and I didn't find the X factor which usually the apple users boast.
At this price point samsung s20 is a much value for money phone which offers a 2k amoled screen, in display finger print and a high resolution camera which takes great photos.

If security is your highest priority then yes choose this device as android is an open source software and is more prone to security attacks."
129,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"Excellent camera 📸 And Display touching very Nice And Smooth and very improvement against
I phone 11 and new processor is very fast"
130,5,Highly recommended,"Thanks Flipkart For this amazing deal! I had a dream of owning a iphone since i had known about.
Im very happy with my purchase & it is totally worth it.
Amazing experience all over !!

Anyone who’s thinking of buying it in 2021, i would simply say go for it without any second thoughts ❤️"
131,5,Excellent,A perfect phone and a good battery super camera and the sound is dynamic overall the phone is perfect for upgrading from lower iPhone model to iPhone 11
132,5,Worth every penny,"Undoubtedly Iphone 11 is the most successful model till now and its performance is extraordinary and the security features are very impressive, display is more vibrant sound quality Camera Quality 5*****, but Iphone should add accessories too and act like scrooge."
133,5,Fabulous!,"I purchased the iPhone 11 a month back. I must say Apple has impressed me yet again . I have been an Apple user for past 5 years . The phone is power packed with amazing features . What impressed me the most was the battery backup the phone offers . Battery can easily run upto 1.5 days in single charge with moderate to
Heavy usage . If you’re looking for a value for money device , I don’t see any other phone in the price range which can match the iPhone 11 .
One thing I didn’t like was that the charger which comes with the phone is a normal charge and not a fast charger .
Special mention for flipkart as well . I got the phone writhing 12 hours of ordering . Packaging was decent and delivery was hassle free"
134,5,Brilliant,"A wort full value for money decision it’s . Simply go for it in 2021 its still a good decision . Awesome camera , Super smothered performance, Heck of build quality. And Most important it protects your privacy."
135,5,Just wow!,"The ultimate performance
Camera is superb
The battery backup also very good i never saw iphone gives this much of battery backup
If any one wana buy iphone 11 definitely i will recommend this mobile
It has the better battery and powerfull processer peak performance glorious camera and the display also 100% high quality lcd display if u had money for for 12 if u dont wana invest much money on that then go for iphone 11 it has maximum same specs only main difference between the 12 and 11 is lcd display vs old and 4g vs 5g but according to price the iphone 11 is more value for money then the 12"
136,5,Must buy!,"Camera is excellent just lack of telephoto mode frankly dose not needed either night mode is just 🙏🙏 12 12 12 mp (2back 1 front) camera lover just don't miss the deal
Display lcd but feel like super amoled
At46999 with no cost EMI just a best deal"
137,5,Terrific purchase,"I use a Note10+ and have been using both iOS and Android devices.

Camera has really good features and portraits are super good, better than Samsung flagship. Overall camera setup can still be enhanced and hopeful for better upgrades on software in next release

Operating system is quite a breeze and user experience of daily usage is very high as compared to Android. I moved to iOS very swiftly in 2 days for all my office work from Note10+

Battery holds up quite well with 4 hrs of call and some light social media usage

Fast charger not available is a big let down and my Note10+ charges in 30 mins with 40% higher Battery capacity and Iphone 11 takes min of 2 hrs

Got this 128gb for under 59k with exchange and quite happy with performance"
138,5,Awesome,"The phone is completely good
As far as camera Apple is king of it
And its a beast in performance
And the battery is pretty good too"

142,3,Does the job,phone is good but in display is 720p lcd in this price range we can get full hd OLED displays with higher refresh rate processor is very good camera is nice but looks kind of oldish in front of todays phone also there's no charging in box had to buy it seperately
143,5,Worth every penny,iPhone is delivered on time. Display is great u won’t feel that it’s a hd panel. Quality is excellent. Sounds is great it has stereo setup. Camera is good. iOS 14.2 comes in the box. U roughly get 113 gb free if u buy 128 gb. This is my second iPhone and i love it. Value for money.
144,5,Super!,"This is my first ever iPhone.
And I truly don’t regret switching to IOS from my Android.

It is easily an alternative to a DSLR camera.
If you’re obsessed with photos and videos, just don’t think twice or don’t compare to other androids(Samsung S10 lite or OnePlus 8/8T), as it’s far better from them in every field.
Comparing will only make you confused.

I am getting an average Screen on Time of around 10 hours with 30 percent left. I haven’t let my device discharged below 30 % as it affects the battery health

Note-
1) Recommended to upgrade to IOS 14.4 immediately because it is a stable version compared to IOS 14.2 out of the box.
2) Don’t charge your device overnight, it harms your battery health and the health drops faster than normal"

Note : images are good after you edit"
162,5,Worth every penny,"Here is the thing

The only reason why you should buy this phone is for the camera, iOS, and if you have headaches looking at AMOLED display.

I’m not an avid gamer but watch a lot of movies on smartphone. However, my migraine attacks increased considerably after using AMOLED Smartphone. That’s why I made a calculated decision to buy iPhone 11. It has the best LCD display and the blacks, though not as natural as an AMOLED, is better than some of the other smartphones.

Adding to this the stereo speakers are great. And by the way, I don’t use headphones due to the same migraine issue so I wanted a smartphone with good stereo separation. This phone is just what I was looking for.

Then about the missing macro cam. I kind of have a mixed feeling because the quality of the images taken using the primary cam is so good that you can just zoom in to get the macro effect.

I have a MacBook Pro which made my life a lot easier because I have a 60 Watt charger that gets my iPhone 11 to 100% in an hour.

Also the whole Apple ecosystem makes a lot of things seamless.

5G is not a big concern for me at least for a few years because I don’t live in a metro, which means it might take another three years for the first 5G signals to get beamed.

Let’s see if this phone can last till then."
163,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"Absolutely powerful gadget. Loved it’s look! Soo glassy and classy. I would definitely recommend this model of Apple. Only disappointed with the 5W charger, one should purchase an 18W adapter for fast charging. Though battery backup is great. Bought it in September 2020, reviewing after so long so I’m gonna put the genuine review here.✅"
164,4,Good quality product,"I was torn between the oneplus 8 pro and the iphone 11. I had to shell out extra money for this, but I say if you can afford it, this truely is the best package.
Mind blowing camera, battery and overall performance. Face Id works like magic even in complete darkness without firing up the screen brightness. The phones with in display fingerprint scanners do this at night time and it really burns your eyes.
I wanted the oneplus for its display but tbh the OLEDs on oneplus is really bad. Flickering and tint issues are really irritating. It doesn’t matter if its LCD, this display works like a charm. Especially if you use it at late night the screen is kind to your eyes.
Many OLEDs have this issue, thats a downside no one talks about.
I say go for it. You will not regret it.
Cheers🤜🏻🤛🏻"
165,5,Excellent,"Seller - SuperComNet ( my trust in you has grown deeper. Thanks for the genuine product )
The package came packed perfectly. The box was sealed which gave me a big relief.

Apple needs no introduction since its the dominant market player. I just love the way how IPhone 11 stands out so boldly. The moment I took it out from the box, I could feel the premium intensity. The body is remarkable and crafted for giving you a elite vibe.

Camera is to die for. There is no other phone that can beat Apple in terms of its processor and the camera. Just flawless. Highly recommend."
166,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"i was confused between 11 and 11 pro. i was going towards 11 pro, but the screen size was not enough for me.
And i saw 11 in the showroom. i didn't find much difference in screen quality.And cameras seems to be ok with me. And i saw offer's in flipkart and made the purchase.
the device is fabulous. The hardware and software quality is excellent. The new iOS is something you need to experience yourself. The drawback i found was absence of fast charger, but the pricing can compensate that. Am using Mi fast charger and things are smooth. if you are more focused to an iPhone than a show off device, this is the best iphone you should purchase."
167,5,Excellent,🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩I loved the Phone.. Every time I pick up the phone it makes me happy... The phone is beast💪💪 and the camera is fabulous 🥰🥰🥰.. I think one of my great purchase from Flipkart.. Thank you Filpkart..
168,5,Super!,"It's a great phone. From camera to display everything is best for the price.
Best camera , best performance. I think everyone should buy it . This phone has best battery life so far in iphone series which I had used earlier. Happy to have it. Thanks Flipkart"
169,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"Released in 2019
In 2021 still the best in segment
Pros:
Camera 4/5 night photograph takes -1
Performance 5/5
Battery backup normal usage 5/5 should last more than a day
Heavy usage battery backup 4/5 as compared have a smaller battery but should give around 5-6h of heavy usage like game play
Battery charging from 18w charger 3.5/5 not as fast as compared to dash charger but does the job well 0-50% in somewhat takes 40 mins which is ok

Cons:
No earpod
No 3.5mm jack connector I remember getting one with iphone 7
No charger - need to buy a separate one as the cable in box is type c to lighting and old cable charges it with 5w which takes approx 3h to charge
Wireless charger can charger upto max 7.5w"
170,5,Classy product,"Got my iPhone 11 today! It’s totally worth it even in 2021. Takes wonderful images and the stabilisation of video on this phone is just awesome although it is a 2019 model. Performance wise it’s ultra fast as expected to be. The only drawback per paper is the screen it has, but in usage I noticed nothing bad and the screen was totally fine for me!
I upgraded from Nokia 6.1 Plus and it’s great 🤩"
171,5,Great product,"Great quality at not so great price, But worth it. Don't go for specs, better performance than so called spec master Chinese phones. The display could have been atleast an smiled one with atleast 90hz at this price point."
172,5,Brilliant,"Wow wow and wow, in 48k you will not get anything better than this, processor is awsome, camera is a beast, display is superb, this is my first iphone, and I am already in love with these"
173,5,Most Price worthy Iphone,"Reviewing within 1st Month


1st Month Review
This is my first Iphone. So been new to the Ios Environment i faced some basic issues. Whatever issues i am facing is because of change in environment.
Video Output is amazing.
Battery - Typical One Day Battery. 20 W fast charger is amazing which charges the iphone within 40-60 Mins ( purchased separately)
Camera - Good and Natural Colours. ( I have Samsung S21+ and not at par with its camera) but the output is same all the time which is good.
Antutu Score around 4 lacs +
Display - Very Good and Video output is fantastic

Overall - Nice overall performance phone with decent battery life and good camera along with amazing video"
174,5,Excellent,"Value for money product. This iphone 11 is really amazing. Again nice release by apple. Great camera, battery backup is excellent. I just love this phone"
175,5,Terrific purchase,"Well , as we all know if its not an Iphone , its not an iphone . The iphones are always beast . The camera game has been level up . The A13 Bionic is just fabulous . The update this year are certainly the camera which is damn good with d addition of wide angle lens as well as ultra wide . If anyones purchasing an iphone for the first time , do opt for the black color . Its just feels more than premium . Battery life is damn good with lasting fully a day . Overall a nice package . Well managed and timely delivery by flipkart always . Cheers to FLIPKART 🤘🏻"
176,5,Worth every penny,"I upgraded from one plus 6 to iPhone 11 and it’s too good. Very smooth, battery also good. I love it. And thanks flipkart for fast delivery."
177,5,Best in the market!,"The only thing i didnt like about the phone is its display as its only an non full hd display means its not 1080p one and not an amoled one of course but still better than all the lcds out there in the market but at this price point android alternatives provide 144hz samoled like the rog phone 5, Aside from that the performance is top notch as you would expect from an Iphone and will last you for many years unlike androids who stop getting updates in less than 2 years"
178,5,Fabulous!,Just an awesome phone...upgraded from 6s to 11 and trust me guys it's super cool with amazing features..loved it ♥️ and a big thank you to Flipkart for delivering it in just 2 days ?
179,4,Value-for-money,"As usual a great product from Apple. but the look wise there were some scope to make it more attractive. from the back it looks nice. picture quality is awesome . face id is blazing fast. The lightning fast bionic processor makes the phone butter smooth.Battery back up is unbeatable and best of the released iPhone.full display is still missing. however, a iPhone is a iPhone. The iPhone lovers know the value of an iPhone 🙂"
180,5,Highly recommended,"Amazing camera quality as expected, battery also has very good performance. Display, body, and touch experience is the best I’ve ever had. Sound quality of speakers is more than sufficient. Apple is known for it’s customer friendly security services and I can see it how. The A13 processor is the best in its work. So I would definitely recommend it for everyone who are looking for it, just go for it without delay.

The most amazing thing it the delivery. Flipkart has delivered it in the span of 17hrs.
Thank you for this mind boggling product both Apple and Flipkart."
181,4,Really Nice,"Great phone and camera and timely delivery by Flipkart!
You wouldn't love the display if you're coming from a one plus or Samsung, go for iPhone 12. If display isn't your priority, this is a great choice."
182,5,Terrific purchase,Very good phone. All the apps are running smoothly. Sleek and sturdy design. No more words for apple as it has its own class.
183,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"After using more than a year of using iPhone11 here is my complete review:
1. Camera is almost perfect 8/10 except for some advantages you’ll see in Samsung S20. (Zoom, Better Image stabilisation etc)
2. Battery performance is 10/10
3. OS performance is 10/10
4. Build Quality 9/10 as you need to buy good quality back cover with tampered
5. Face Lock feature is awesome 10/10
6. You need to buy new charger but don’t buy more than 18 watt charger optimum is 15 / 18 watt charger. For fast charging with 15/18 watt use airplane mode while charging.
DONT BUY ABOVE 18watt LIKE 20watt THAT WILL DESTROY THE HEALTH OF IPHONE BATTERY.
7. Go for 128 GB or more, as pics, videos , mainly App size is way more in iphone than from Andriod."
184,5,Perfect product!,Awesome Product. Initially I was looking for green color but wasn't available and then I went for white one and believe me it's really awesome color.
185,5,Terrific purchase,"Fkng awesome phone, you won’t regret spending money on it.
Battery is 3110mah, sufficient amount if you’re not continuously using it. Performance is up-to to the point.
Face ID is extremely fast and smooth, you wont even realize you’ve unlocked your phone.
FYI I’m reviewing this product after 3 months of usage because I wanted to know how the battery and other things are in this phone. So if you are thinking of buying it, Just go for it."
186,5,Great product,"This iphone 11 by apple is simply amazing . Ios is so crisp and smooth that you will love .
I will definitely recommend it , earlier i was confused between iphone 11 and oneplus 9r. But i have made a correct choice.
Go with this beast without any hasitation."
187,5,excellent,"I liked it very much, super performance , giving best battery life around one day. fast charging is super. camera quality is excellent no words."
188,5,Simply awesome,"Incredible phone with a excellent battery and a better experience.
Those who are concerned about its screen quality.Trust me this is one of the best IPS panal.
Previously I used OnePlus 5t which had a full hd AMOLED display,but I didn't notice a huge difference.
If a get a fabulous deal then just go for it."
189,5,Fabulous!,This is my first I phone and I'm very happy to have it but it's battery life is not good as Android have that's all. All over phone is Awesome
190,5,Perfect product!,"Excellent service by Flipkart. The phone is true value for money, the camera is great especially the low light night photography.
The processor is fast making gaming a lot of fun.
I read a lot of negative reviews about the display but I was using a OnePlus before and somehow the iphone 11 display is more easy on the eyes and the adaptive brightness is more effective than any of the other phones that I have used.
Charging is a bit slow owing to the smaller charger included in the box inste...

191,5,Mind-blowing purchase,It’s a quiet good for new users. And I’m happy with it. Thanks apple and Flipkart too. 😊♥️
192,4,Good choice,"I have my first iPhone
I love it
using 15 day very good performance

Mobile- 5/4
Charging- 5/5
Camera- 5/5
Battery backup -5/5
Display- 5/4
Courier facility- 5/0 Very bad
Courier facility is poor. I have not happy in courier facility.."
193,5,Super!,"Good display in this phone however screen is LCD, you'll get a bit disappointed .
Camera is superb , I have tried underwater shot is sea water, works good. Video quality is a bit inferior as compared to similar price range phones.
Performance is superb. Maybe the best in this range , even with A13 bionic chip and 4GB ram, it works really smooth.
Battery is fine, you'll get decent backup.
No charger inside , that's very disappointing for 1st time users. I had previously iPhone and iPad so it never bothered me , but it can be an issue.
Overall it is the Best value for money iPhone , and by a margin.
But now , prices have come down so you can go a bit high and buy i phone12 too"
194,5,Perfect product!,"At time of writing this review this phone processor definitely beat any flagship android phone !

Upgraded from 7 Plus which is also quite good

But this phone performance is huge ! Fast and always to roll 😅
Low light Camera is great
But i think portrait mode is not good as iPhone 7 plus
In this phone portrait mode is looks like artificial but on my previous phone it looks like dslr photo maybe i am missing setting on this !

Otherwise everything is good !"
195,5,Classy product,This is very second time I am using iphone I am not a huge fan of I phone but as my past experience iphone is always iphone whn you use it in your hand and it feel firmly buildup and camera quality is awesome processing is fast and realy smooth while using it.Night mode is awesome and photography is brilliant. Go for it and it will be great if you buy it worth it
196,5,Super!,"I’d like to start by saying that the overall experience with the iPhone 11 is super smooth and amazing in every aspect. It’s an absolute powerhouse.

Performance - The Apple A13 Bionic is super optimised. You will not face any performance issue at all. You will never have to worry about the lag on this one.

Battery - Battery life is one of the best you can get in a iPhone at this time. It’s better than the XR. Average use can get you more than a day and heavy use will get you through the day. Although I would suggest you to buy an 12W Apple charger (iPad technically). It won’t heat your iPhone much as the 18W and will get the job done.

Camera - Camera is top notch. The wide angle and night mode are amazing to click photos and they give an artistic touch to your photos. Although the front camera has a slight smoothing feature which is basically due to smart HDR that smoothens your pictures like some beauty plus application. But still the camera is amazing and one of the best in market right now.

Display - Display isn’t bad at all. Do not believe what they say go and see for yourselves. I know it’s a 820p display but if you’re coming from an OLED you will notice the difference otherwise it works fine for most of the people. You will get used to it after a few weeks and the vessels aren’t that noticeable too. Overall display is good.

Storage - I’d recommend going for the 128GB variant as the iPhone 11 is capable of capturing in 4K 60fps you’ll run out soon if you click or shoot videos regularly. 128Gb is the sweet spot for all.

Colour - Purple and Green are my favourites. I personally dig the green which is technically teal so I bought the green 128gb variant. The iPhone 11s red is not similar to XRs red. The 11s red is lighter compared to XR.

Overall - If you’re thinking to buy an iPhone I’d suggest you go for this one instead of the Pro version as the price isn’t worth it when the iPhone 11 version is getting the job done. Pro isn’t worth the money. You can keep this phone for coming 3-4 years with you considering the updates and performance."
197,1,Absolute rubbish!,"Worst product delivered by Flipkart
After 10days of delivery mobile will not work properly
Volume and silent buttons are not working.
No worth to buy in Flipkart.
Please don’t buy apple products in Flipkart"
198,5,Terrific,"Good buy.. working perfectly !

That was upgrade from 6S to 11. I see no deference in both the phones except:
1. Battery performance
2. Camera quality
3. Face detection unlock

Go for it..!"
199,5,Wonderful,"Ok, so after almost 3 years I am again back into Apple Ecosystem. Switching from Android to iOS has just one disadvantage imo, and that's you can't take your WhatsApp data restored to iOS. Everything starts fresh, pretty sad. I am so glad that I chose iPhone 11 over 12. With 5G nowhere in India for at least an year will have an added advantage to iPhone 11. Spending extra 25k just for A14 chipset and OLED display is not a clever choice. Anyways, a fantastic phone with everything fit perfectly. The BIG advantage is obviously it's battery - better than iPhone 12 and XR."
200,5,Must buy!,"I will just say its an awesome phone. Starting from speed , battery life, resolutions, camera quality, features it is superior in all department versus its predecessor. Also would like to state that at this price point it is an extraordinary value product. Recommend anyone who is looking for a highend smart phone within a range of 60k to 100K. ."
201,5,Terrific,"Have used both iPhone X and iPhone XR and I can say upgrade only if you want better camera it’s awesome with great display even though lcd but still better than oled on iPhone X or XS.
The camera is huge improvement in low light and very nice improvement in less light and times better than iPhone X but not that big improvement on iPhone XR in day light but very big improvement in low light."
202,5,Worth every penny,"Just go for it without a second thought, if you are looking for a best phone in the market and want to save 40k to not go for iPhone 11 pro, the only thing i think this product is feel missing is Oled display software do the job of portrait, so go for it rather than 11 pro. Everything is at top with this phone. I am writing this review after using this phone for more than 2 months."
203,4,Delightful,Nice camera for front and back.. The display is not as good because it makes sound when we tap on it! But overall it’s a good phone.
204,5,Awesome,Best iphone ever.. best value for money phone.. easy to hold and face unlock is very fast and works even in dark.. looks very cool.. delivered in one day.. best flipkart experience and get also the original product. Red one is the .best color and most selling color so I love red one.
205,3,Just okay,"Genuine review after few weeks.
Decent camera quality.
Don't expect to meet the quality and features of the upcoming brands with cheaper prices and better megapixels. Overall smooth experience and everything seems so good. If you have used iOS before, you know the ease of using it.
Looks so secure and fast.
Definately it beats my 6GB phones in performance.
If you play games don't bother about RAM, the processor kills it.
Overall a good choice to switch from Android to iOS.
Don't expect that VOC charge or 108MP camera, it's iOS. No one can beat the performance and feel of Apple.
Only a small disappointed with the camera, you'll still find few noise.
Hope this helps you decide."
206,5,Fabulous!,"I really liked the budget iPhone. First I thought display would be issue as it is a LCD with less pixels, then after using my perception changed and I never felt like I am using an outdated display. Though I also use S 10+ with Amoled display.

So this is perfect iPhone and a real value for money."
207,5,Fabulous!,"Awesome mobile… Battery Backup is really impressive, getting a solid battery life of 1.5 days with a normal usage. Even if u are a heavy user, u will get a day of backup for sure. Excellent audio quality. Overall I’m very much satisfied with the device :)"
208,3,Just okay,"I have been using iphone 11 model since its launch. Here is my review
Pros:
Performance
Privacy
OS Updates
Build quality
Sound

Cons:
Display issue: After using for nearly a year a small line popped up at left notch and slowly it spread to right notch. Well it could an exceptional case

At this price range  could have given OLED screen.

Price: I strongly believe this product has been overpriced.
Signal Issue: I see this issue across the  devices.
Charging: I takes around 4hrs for 100% with inbox charger provided by 

Final verdict:  could have provide more features at this price and focus more on build quality.
If you wanna buy  products wait for 2 years after launch to get it at better price."
209,5,Just wow!,"Not mere a phone , Its more than that for fun and enjoy life. Just grab it. Best luck"
210,4,Delightful,Received product before the delivery date performance is very good value for money no problem till now camera is also good but the screen is lcd which is not good and irritate some time so you have to compromise the screen Flipkart services is good and nice
211,5,Classy product,"Finally switched to iOS from android
There is some things which u can’t do like using android but it’s worth to iOS. Battery backup is good holds for a day in average. Cam quality is okay. Good night mode visibility."
212,5,Terrific,Very good smartphone and value for smoother and speedy response and work
213,5,Terrific,"This is very nice phone with great camera, performance, battery but their display is not good as their price overall best iphone to purchase right now"
214,5,Just wow!,"Got delivered by good packing from Flipkart with a agreed time line. Apple always stood good and great products towards their customers and this is my 2nd Iphone overall experience with phone is great, Especially when it comes battery gives long-standing performance for applications and gaming purposes, Camera is one of the great features includes in this mobile

I will strongly suggest this !"
215,5,Fabulous!,"Iphone is best ever but Flipkart delivered is quality on the product is so promising i really satisfied and trust with it by Flipkart assured
Tq..🥰"
216,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"Quite osm more then expected . Purple color truly recommended its lookin so beautiful then others .Someone suggest me and have selected the same color its beautiful.


Performance is far better then my last i phone"
217,5,Just wow!,"My first iPhone. Still wondering where was I lost all this while. Always thought that an iPhone is just to pricey and not worth its cost. Trust me, I didn’t regret once for this mighty purchase. It is a different ecosystem all together and I have become an Apple fan instantly. Now all my gadgets ought to be Apple. Just seamless, timeless, super smooth, flamboyant, style statement, and the list is endless. The back camera is worth the hype not the selfie camera. Sound quality is surround sound, battery works 1.5 days with 4 hours of on screen time. After 15 days of usage, more than just satisfied with Apple. Kudos to Flipkart for genuinely fast delivery."
218,5,Worth every penny,"PROS:
1. Ballistic performance
2. Amazing image quality from the camera setup
3. Superb battery performance,
4. Design
5. Fit and finish.
6. iOS 13 integration with the hardware.
CONS:
1. Display quality leaves a lot to be desired. The non-1080p display is hardly noticeable during regular usage and is more than a pass. But if you are someone who use their phone for a majority of video playback, you’re in for a disappointment. Otherwise, it’s perfect for every other need.
2. The overall size and weight of the device is a tad too bulky for my preference.
3. That pathetic 5W charger. Less said the better. Get yourself that 18W ASAP."
219,5,Just wow!,iPhone 11 is good but if someone want Superior phone then go for 11 pro because screen display is too good from iPhone 11 and as well as camera quality
220,5,Super!,"Everything good as expected from Apple, but only thing thing missing is the 18w power adapter, because if the phone is compatible for fast charging and it takes more than 3 hours for full charge on a normal charger then it should come bundled with the 18w adapter."
221,4,Good choice,Great product as usual. Handy phone with best processor and camera quality in the market. Recommended 128GB storage 👍
222,5,Simply awesome,excellent mobile phone with amazing feautures. 100% value for money.The greatest attribute was its battery(all day long usage). dont hesitate to buy. Only difference between 11pro and 11 is display and its telescope lens remaining all are same
223,5,Great product,Terrific!!! Lucky to get this phone in first lot. First switch over for me from android. awesome camera.. One of the best in class.. go for iphone 11 if you are the first time user.
224,5,Fabulous!,Best phone in this price segment people say that it is a IPS display but don’t judge a book with the specs sheet only I have not seen any LCD Display like this in any smartphone industry leading IPS display . Everything is awesome in this phone but sometime but apple should have been giving OLED in this price segment
225,3,Nice,"Iphone 11 black 64gb is really a cool phone

1. Camera is superb using it long time heats the phone a bit
2. iOS 13 is elegant and nice
3. Video yet to test
4. Charger : Phone has the capability to fast charge but charger is not capable of doing it which frustrates being a top brand and providing and charger like this is worst from Apple
5. Sound quality especially in headphones is wonderful"
226,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"This is phone is super duper sexy.
You will get in love with this phone the moment you will unbox it.
Performance is awesome.
So smooth, easy to handle.
Sometimes, if working continuously, you will feel that the phone is heavy otherwise you won’t if worked for shorter period of time.
I would personally suggest you to go for 128GB version because it will be a true value for money.
Talking about colour, I find white colour as a royal one."
227,5,Worth every penny,"no complaint against the display it's very crisp , though it is not the OLED but if you put side by side and compare with iPhone xs you hardly notice any difference , i noticed the brightness because 11 has 600 nits compare to 1200 nits on xs . other wise you never feel that its a 720 p display. very very good quality LCD screen you can't compare with any other LCD screen it's far better than any other LCD screen available in market. battery is very impressive , and Love the sound of stereo speakers very loud and clear. this is my first iOS phone and i AM very happy with it, last but not the least the camera it's awesome specifically in night you don't believe that how good quality pictures it's can take. at this price point don't hesitate to buy just by go and grab it."
228,5,Super!,"brilliant design I personally liked red colour
processing speed
camera
battery
display
everything is gorgeous in iphone 11
this is super smooth"
229,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"Wow!! What a beauty.. i was a hardcore fan of android and i always felt iphone is overrated. Features are far inferior to android and costs 4 times. I am a heavy user and for me battery life is one of the more important feature and everyone knows apple lacked in it. This is my 1st iphone and I am loving the change. RAM concept was totally misunderstood.. it is the most fluidic set I ever used. In hand feel is premium. Display is good but I loved the one plus more in this. Battery life is a shocker to me in a good sense. I am able to pass a whole day in a single charge. Connectivity is better than the other handset i used. Camera is good and comes with so many features.


Overall it is the best port for me from android to ios and i am still in very early stage. With every passing day I am loving it."
230,5,Awesome,"Features and design is good bt not satisfied with display i lyk apple bcz of their display quality bt in dis ph they give same diplay like other brands give us i hv 6s too frankly speaking both 6s and 11 have lcd display bt lots of diff between them
Apple previous lcd display was awsm bt nw jst making money like other brands vary disappointing it feels like m playing ios in samsung screen"
231,5,Awesome,So good look comfortable iPhone 11 I am so very happy my life first time iPhone used camera is 👌 sound quality is clear sounds
232,4,Wonderful,"If I consider it just as a smartphone, it's pretty expensive. Have to admit that I payed a lot of money just for the brand. I understand people use apple products for years and if we consider the time span the phone is also worth for the money. But, there are also phones available under 10k and runs for years. Yes, it is true.
Buy, this phone only if you want to show others how much you earn, otherwise it's nothing but just a smartphone like others are."
233,3,Does the job,"The phone is awesome undoubtedly and worth the purchase .

I had preordered it from Flipkart, but this time I am little disappointed with the packaging from Flipkart . I had preordered iPhone 7 Plus too but that time the packaging was excellent but didn’t get the same experience this time .... hence rating it a little low. Flipkart should have packed it better as it’s worth is much more .... Expecting betterment next time ..."
234,5,Terrific,Switched from Android to Iphone. great experience till now. Night photography feature is Awesome. Scope of improvement in front camera. Fantastic & seamless gaming experience.

But ye, overall I just love this phone♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️ My first ever iPhone😄 My daddy gifted me as a birthday gift, so it will be my mark to return something special more than this♥️ I only want to thank is to my dad.... Thank you Apple for your wonderful product😘🍎❤️😇"
236,5,Great product,I was using android phone earlier..I was thinking apple phones are much more costy than other phones with less specifications..so why to waste money in this??..But trust me guys once if you start using ios then you won't go back to android...beleive me this phone is the best than all other...There is no other phone which can beat iphones in terms of camera..iphones gives the best real image..its very faster and smoother than android phones...if you think to switch to ios iphone 11 is the best option I will suggest..giving a review after 1 and half months usage
237,3,Just okay,"iPhone 11 is not better than Samsung s20 at the same price
If you need to buy a phone under 65000/ pls go for Samsung S20, this is better choice for you. I'm not satisfied"
238,4,Value-for-money,"Reviewing after 10 days
Camera:- In this price segment best camera phone for Video as well as photo. This mobile not for the selfie lover due lack of beautification option.
Display :- LCD display not justify its price. Quality not upto the mark. Light yellowish tint observed on display even after colour correction.
Battery :- Battery back up good, It last full day.
Professor :- No doubt about Iphone processor. It is best A13 bionic chip better than SD 865.
OS:- Little bit difficult to understand for who coming from Android. User experience at Best level. U will gate OS and Security update atleast 3 yrs.
Build :- Build quality is super Aluminium frame and Back glass panel. Kindly use back case cover and tempered glass for better safety.
Speaker :- Stereo speaker is loud and having good bass level. Impressed with speaker."
239,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"The best phone I have ever owned!

Camera: Rear camera is one of the best in the industry. The front camera is7/10. My Poco f1 with Google Camera mod took better selfies.

Performance: If you are moving from an android device, the performance is unreal. The sync between hardware and software is unreal! There is virtually no lag at all. All games run on it smooth AF! Bluetooth, WiFi performance is superb as well.

Battery Life: Getting close to 7-7.5 of screen on time. Very good in comparison to previous iPhones.

Build Quality: The Best, probably second to the iPhone 12. But best in the business.

Cons:
1. The glass back is a finger print magnet( but it adds a premium feeling as well)
2. The front camera could have been better. I think the sensor is too small for artificial lighting.
3. No charging brick in the box.( really Apple??!)


Conclusion: Just go for it! I got it at 49k, which I think was a superb deal. Super content with my purchase!"
240,5,Terrific,"Excellent phone. Got it for 29k after exchange and bank offer. Totally value for money at that price. Loved the product red colour.
iOS is smooth and no lags at all. Shifted from android though I have used iOS earlier and totally loving iOS.
Got an original sealed box piece so go ahead and order without worrying. Also received the iOS 14.5.1 after turning on the phone immediately.
For people who are worried that there is no 5G in this phone don't hesitate to buy it. 5G is going to take time for better coverage all over India and also the rates of packs will be high initially.
Thank you Flipkart for super fast delivery considering the current situation!
Totally recommend this phone."
241,5,Terrific purchase,"iPhone 11 is the real flagship killer in my opinion.I have been using it for a week so I might post more later.Don’t go for the specification jargon put out like 1080 p quad HD,16 GB ram,these things mean nothing when you use IPhone,the user experience and refinement you get will make you realise it is the best phone you will use.The only thing missing might be faster 90hz or more display which is essential in my opinion. The deeper darks of AMOLED screen is overhyped in my opinion,while ignoring the background flicker.One drawback I have found is little bit of temperature while charging. On a positive note battery is exceptional.
In conclusion IPhone 11 is the best value for money smartphone and Flipkart does the best customer service"
242,4,Good quality product,"It is a very good phone but price is very high. May be in case of exchange we may get more. But need to bare this much amount initially.

Regarding phone, it is okay. Not upto the mark. We can get good android phones under this price. And really painful to buy charger and earphones, this is really con in iphones. Some bluetooth earphones won’t be supported fully like same Bluetooth earphones working fine with android and working with IOS but less sounds compare to android.

Pros:
Phone looking good
Water resistant
Camera is awesome
No lagging
Face ID in night also

Cons:
Body to screen ratio is higher than any android mobiles in this price
No Charger and Earphones, need to spend 4k more atleast
I found lagging very few times like while playing free fire
Sometimes apps are crashing may be due to Network, not sure
Face ID won’t work if you keep your phone near to your face or if you can’t hold properly that means we need to keep certain distance when our face completely visible to camera, this is really annoying. And only we can keep 2 face IDs only.
Hotspot is really annoying and irritating, sometimes my laptop is not connecting need to do turn off and on continuously until it connects. In between if we turn on TV, hotspot won’t connect automatically to TV

If you are a normal person and don’t want much security I don’t suggest this phone.

If you are a IOS fan and want to use Iphone once, you can try.

I hope this review will help you. Thanks."

If you are familiar with apple then go for it. camera is good which can match up with next 3 years, battery is good than all other iPhones. Definitely morning to evening-8 it can do. Display is not that bad, you will be satisfied. Best mobile worth for the money. Best for one handed issue. Very less overheating than other mobiles in market. Go for 128 gb or 256. This iphone can live upto next 3-4 years for sure. Enjoy Apple👌🏾"

247,5,Excellent,"It is iPhone. There isn't much I could say about the phone that isn't out there already.
If you get a good deal including discount or offer on any card, just go for it.
Only one major drawback, it comes with 5V basic charging which is a big let down.

From Flipkart POV, the delivery was on time, the product was in proper condition so there is no reason for anything less than 5 star."
248,5,Perfect product!,Good phone over all but if you want to buy it from pubg then you have to compromise with battery it charge very slow too but pubg performance is top notch l. I am impressed with tha performance i was using oneplus 7 pro but performance was not good as this iphone 11 has its very nice and smooth
249,5,Super!,"The only issue is the unavailability of fast charging adapter in the box. It really takes a hell lotta time to get 100%.

250,5,Brilliant,"Loved everything about it - the camera, the display, the overall built of the phone. But just not sure if this phone or any phone for that matter is worth this crazy price. Nonetheless a good phone that I intend on using for atleast 4-5 years. I would pick RED or YELLOW."

266,5,Super!,Overall I am happy with the Apple iPhone 11. For past four years I used one plus 3T and personally I loved the phone and have no complaints so far. I thought of initially upgrading to the latest OnePlus phone but seeing the negative remarks/opinions I changed my mind and went for iPhone and eventually felt it was a good decision. It will take some time to adjust to iPhone if you are an android user but truly you will love it after some time.Camera and performance of iPhone is superb.

All in all a very good product to go for if you are not looking for 5g and screen quality-is far better than lcd standards nice color reproduction."
268,4,Wonderful,"After using it for more than 3 months , I’m writing the review-

Camera - excellent front and back (could have been better if night mode was present in front camera)

Fastness - extremely smooth and fast ( u May clearly experience it if u are shifting from android to iOS for the first time)

Battery - Though it may appear that the battery is less than 3500 mAH , but believe me it’s much better than those android ones claiming 5000 mAH. U may easily keep on surfing internet and other things without the battery dying up.

Only complaint I have with apple product is that they could have given the charger and headphones with it. The usb cable is of no use due to the port which it has."

290,5,Terrific purchase,"After using it for nearly 1 month I feel its a great product

4. No heating observed with normal usage. that mean I didnt play any games on this device so cant comment how it behaves while playing some games.

291,5,Awesome,"I am using IOS devices since last 4 years. So its not a new thing for me. But this model is such an extraordinary product that Apple has ever made. I am putting some points for helping other buyers.
Battery- Don't know what technology they are using in it, but literally it shocks everyone by its power consumption and backup. A big 👍 to Team Apple.
Camera- People are usually running behind the numbers of lenses. But when it comes to an Iphone, u don't need to count the lenses. Its Dynamic Ranges, Depth and Natural photos will blow your mind.
Processor- I think we shouldn't talk about it as everyone had said about it and given it the award of most powerful processor.
Budget- Always too much costly but u don't need to change your phone in every 2-3 years as it will last long.

🙂"
292,5,Simply awesome,"No doubt why cost what it cost? No complain about any specifications a fluid, luxurious experience with all sturdy design and premium looks. Although the battery should be more and why on earth did Apple choose not to add a charger is out of any logic and excuses. Except for that the device is great to use and add Appley style to your looks. Let's be honest or else why would we go for iphone right? Some people face problem with 64 GB internal memory for those I would recommend buying a SanDisk ixpand flash drive of 64-128GB. I am using it and it serves the purpose. As always a pleasing experience with buying in flipkart as the product delivered within just 2 days. And a great and welcoming response from the flipkart call associates. I overall had a wonderful experience."
293,5,Perfect product!,"Very nice and butyful phone camera not best as I expected but it is. Ok.Performance is amazing and marvels.
Heating issue found .I don’t know why that happening disappointed on that. Battery is good no problem.for android users don’t suddenly chenge to iPhone because it is more tuff than we think to adjust with the new iPhone.i am saying from my on experience."
294,5,Highly recommended,"Wow!!!
This product is a beast man,performance is very very amazing .Great camera ,shooting videos for you YouTube channel gainz clip.Battery life is good.Used to play a lot of games like Call of duty at max frame rate and high graphic.This phone is a beast works really really well.
Just go for this.Good service by Flipkart as well."
295,5,Perfect product!,"This phone justifies the price in which it comes. Its battery is average for gamers but i get good backup as i dont play games. Being an LCD screen its awesome 60hz feels like 90hz screen if you apply a good glass. Its gets heat a little for heavy usage. The Camera is just love, better than other phones today also( oneplus 9pro samsung s21 too but their price is more) Its a good package overall"
296,5,Just wow!,Upgraded from 6S and worth it. Very happy with the performance and the purchase and was delivered in a nice packing before the scheduled delivery date.

I am very happy. With my iPhone 11 👍🏻
Best seller I give five star support"

Apple an unbeatable quality products company ...no doubts for their innovation in mobile industries ...little confusing matter about not giving charging adopter and earphones in box...but any way best deal for best iphone on flipkart...!!!"
299,5,Wonderful,"This is my first iPhone. Thought a lot before putting this much amount for a phone, but it’s turning out to be worth every penny spent.
Got a good deal from Flipkart. The camera is awesome, battery looks to be pretty decent, performance unquestionably good."
300,5,Classy product,"Awesome phone, good photo quality and satisfied with battery backup. Only problem i felt was while hotspot is switched ON, the phone gets heating issue, other than that everything is super cool."
301,5,Perfect product!,This phone is beauty . I was using i phone 12 and shiefted to 11 instead of doing upgrade. I will not talk about camera battery bla bla as i phone 11 is name in itself more than enough . If u r ok with budget just go for it with and hazzel. But remember buy 128 gb only if u want to go for long with this device else if u r using for months 64 is also ok .
302,4,Pretty good,"Good product , on time delivery, genuine product .
I have buyed black colour iPhone 11 and recommend you to buy it ."
303,5,Brilliant,"This is the best purchase I have ever made in terms of phone,,,, iPhone 11 has the complete package of Camera, Battery Backup, and Best IPS panel which doesn’t bother to a moderate User.

A13 chip runs any app or high end games like butter through knife, you just cannot compare this phone to an android device.

It’s Been 2 years since the launch of iPhone 11 but still a best & balanced phones in 2021 which don’t get holes in your pocket. The conclusion is you can blindly go for it. Cheers ✌️"
304,5,Perfect product!,"A great device with a good battery backup that can last a day.
I Liked the cameras as well. The night mode feature works pretty well on this.
The call quality (mic and speaker) is amazing with all the noise cancellation enabled on the device.

Overall a good flagship to consider buying in 2021."

Battery: awesome
Display: awesome
Performance:awesome

Camera: awesome in light-but Low light camera performance is not very good"
306,4,Wonderful,I just loved the phone .... as I was waiting for phone cover this couldn’t able to review the phone..... camera quality is superb plus the features of phone... good phone all must buy.....
307,5,Perfect product!,Nice phone to buy with such offers its worth it if u can afford it just go for it
308,4,Good choice,One of my Fav Brand Apple and the Iphone 11 was a cherry on top so no comments for quality and performance but Flipkart please packing this product good way and extra safety this is my feedback for ur service.
309,4,Pretty good,"Good product. Bought on a good deal. Been around a week since started using.
Display is a little dull as compared to other iPhone models.
Sometimes gets heated up while charging with Apple 18W fast charger.
Games like COD are running smooth.
Battery is decent enough to give you a day’s time between 2 recharges."

313,5,Fabulous!,"I have been using android from last 9 years and this is my first iPhone and they are good camera multitasking games even display is great though an lcd panel but colours are rich and vibrant.

One liner - A premium device with all features. 🙂"
314,5,Wonderful,"Works seamlessly, I get an avg 1.5 days battery life with moderate usage.
Can’t really notice the low resolution LCD of this phone until you compare it with an AMOLed screen.
Usually heats up 10 to 30% when doing high intensive tasks. Camera is no doubt at par with the flagship phones with good low light captures compared to iPhone 8.
Overall iPhone 11 is better choice unless you want top notch camera and screen."
315,4,Delightful,"I was using iPhone 6s from a long time and I’ve recently upgraded to iPhone 11. No doubt its a good phone, however it comes with 5W charger which is pretty slow for this phone. Upon checking I found phones which sold out of india having a 12W charger in the box. It’ll take upto 3hrs to charge the phone to 100%. Charger hold a important place for any phone, we cannot wait for a long time to charge a phone. I know this will not change anything but just want to share it."
316,5,Simply awesome,"Osm & fabulous phone..just upgraded from iPhone7 to iPhone 11. supersonic processor,High end camera,grt display.Using 2-3 days battery is excellent it gives 24 hrs to me..face id .👌🏻👍🏻 thnx to 🍎 & FPKT ..👍🏻"
317,5,Super!,Thanx Flipkart giving fast delivery with genuine price iPhone 11 work really very good camera is very nice
318,4,Delightful,Just the display held it from being a 5star phone ....at the age if oleds at 90/120hz its a lcd with 60hz with bezzels thats are 2017 ish .some people will argue that it can pass by and yes it did i came from a s8 that was the best displays till 2018 and one of the bests still today ...after 1week it my eyes kinda adapeted it but whatever and argument this display cannit be justfied at this price range..and last bumper is the 5w charge like seriously.just buy a third party charger
319,4,Wonderful,"The phone is genuinely very good in terms of processor A14 bionic. I had never used apple before so I had a very high level of expectation which I didn't meet. The main focus of apple phones is camera and I have been using One Plus 7 pro for the past two years and believe me with perfect mods and google camera, One Plus beats iPhone 11.

Iphone is indeed very handy and looks premium. On the other hand if I am investing 50k, might as well find everything perfect with my phone.

320,5,Excellent,"Got mobile @56,990 on 8 oct 2020 when all other platforms were selling iPhone 11 for more than 65k.
Thank you Flipkart for bank offer and great discount. Also mobile is delivered under 15 hrs from order.
Screen is LCD but won't matter much, and little bit bulky. No Problem phone or you can say Default IPhone for all.
I'm using ios devices for last 6 years and this piece is best in every Aspect (using ios 14).
No camera comparison with other smartphone in this range. Night mode also works best, and Portraits filter with bokeh effect are at it's best. If you are an IPhone lover this must be your Default iPhone."
321,3,Nice,"Although it’s an iPhone, it doesn’t give anything extraordinary for the price. My first iPhone, didn’t switch from android. After using for approximately 2 months,here’s a genuine review;
Pros-
1. It’s an iPhone
2. Feels premium
3. Good battery

Cons-
1. Network issues, compared to android phone worth 18 thsnd this iPhone lags behind at places with internet speed and also ability to catch WiFi signal is less at places where u hv weak signals.
2. Camera not comparable to one plus 6 also


Overall a decent phone but not at all value for money."
322,5,Just wow!,"Apple i Phone is the best phone available in the market. I was bored of all the android phone on the market they all are same whether it's one plus or Samsung s9+ . best interface awesome battery life, camera is ok not the best."
323,3,Just okay,"Iphone 11 initially worked great, after three months phone was not responding or not turning over night. Got a replacement device after visiting authorised service center. Not to blame the seller or flipkart, just shareing my experience. But iphone 11 is such a powerful device which is more than enough for a normal user. I usually take my work on iphone 11 i was amazed the way it handles things."
324,5,Highly recommended,"Almost a month now and it has been a great experience. Camera is very good and battery stands for a day with normal usage. Though you can’t do much customisation in iphone but I m okay with things being simple.
Overall it’s a good purchase and pretty satisfied with this device."
325,5,Must buy!,"Only Flipkart offers the iPhone 11( or atleast used to, when I ordered ;) ) at almost the exact INR equivalent of their US prices. Now that's real value.

How well this product holds up, only time will tell. Though a brief summary of the pros and cons for the prospective buyer out there :

Pros :

1. Those cameras are something special. Absolute magic, maybe second only to the pixel lineup. I know this as I have used both of them now.

2. A well designed, well engineered product - the moment you hold the iPhone 11, you *know* there's something special about it - the heft, the materials used, the proportions - everything just clicks in place.
Ofcourse there's the 'Apple tax' involved by means of omission of the charger and earphones inside the box but hey, for the price that I've got this piece of beauty, I ain't complainin' :)


3.iOS - it's restricted, yes..it's a walled garden, also yes.. but it just ""works"". Trust me, the beautiful synergy of the hardware and software designed specifically for this hardware is on full display here - no lags, no freezes, no hangups.. like the apple folks keep advertising every now and then, everything just ""works"".

Then there are the timely OS updates. I got an update within hours of booting up the phone.

If you have been an android user previously who's switched to iphone and the Apple ecosystem like I have, you WILL notice the difference - the same apps designed for Apple iOS feel different and more smooth than the apps on Android. What baffles me the most is that Google's own apps like mail, YouTube, Duo, etc work better on iPhone than on their own Android ecosystem - I simply can't fathom why.. but then again, why should I complain ;)


There.. I have tried, in my own limited way, the top 3 reasons why you should go for the iPhone, if you do have the budget for the same.


Now let's explore the cons.


1. That pathetic LCD 720 p screen - good Lord, that screen is a total bummer ! A horrible 720p 60 hz option in this day and age of super Amoled, 120 hz high refresh screens. No amount of Apple marketing wizardry can take away that fact.

2. The full Apple experience comes at a price - their own apps and services are all pricey - be it Apple tv, music, the iCloud ..etc


3.iOS is not even half as user friendly and customisable as Android - though the iOS 14 update does bring in some customisable features, they can't hold a candle to sheer range of options android provides to it's users.


I hope my measured review helps you make the right choice. If you do decide to jump into the Apple walled garden, atleast make an informed jump ;)"
326,5,Super!,"Switched from IPhone 7 and the transition has been super smooth. Great specs, camera, even better Battery and powerful performance. Got it at a great price of 58999.
Go for it !"
327,5,Brilliant,"Long time android user finally changed to iOS. Takes some getting used to, but I actually like more control on iPhone in what’s going on rather than the behind the scene Android. The phone is solid with good performance."
328,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"Switched from iPhone X to iPhone 11 128 GB Version. Actually amazed by the experience. Large Screen Size, Fast processor, Dual SIM Support.. This is the best that one can expect !! Thank You Apple and also Flipkart for the Festive Offer."
329,2,Slightly disappointed,"Have been owning a Oneplus 5T for 3 years now
Moved to iPhone 11 thinking camera and performance will be top class
But believe it or not, even the camera output is not upto the mark as my 3-year old OP
User interface feels like Apple hasn’t made any changes from the time of iPhone 6
Android on the other hand is leaps and bounds ahead
Battery life is ok, lasts more than a day for my usage which is mainly for calls and occasional YouTube usage in a day
Display is not at all as good as 90 Hz or 120Hz displays you get in cheaper Android phones these days
Charging is also not that fast although I bought a separate 20W fast charger
Overall disappointed"
330,4,Delightful,Camera is good only for close up shots n not long shots... Main thing to buy iPhone is for camera but bit disappointed.... Display touch is good... Battery life gives u 2 days if u charge 100% .. speakers without earphones r amazing ... No hanging at all.. Not so worth for 69k....
331,5,Brilliant,"After so many thoughts i have shifted from Realme X2 to Iphone 11.
Pros:
Rich feel of having iPhone of course 😁
Performance is top notch
Battery life is good, approximately 1 day backup with 6 hrs of screen time(i watch mainly videos and play pool)
Value for money as compared to other Iphones.
Cons:
Realme x2 was having smoled screen with bery good colour reproduction it is having LCD screen no where stand close to that but overall better than other LCD screens.
This is the only con i found out till now."
332,4,Pretty good,Bought it in April 2021 and writing review on October after using it for months. It works amazing. No issue faced till now. This is my first iPhone I was very afraid to buy from third party but you can go for this guys. Bought it for 45k in a great deal. Thankful for decent phone.
333,2,Expected a better product,"Camera quality is not good.
It’s like I’m taking pictures from real-me phone’s camera. Not like iphone. My friends have iphone and when we compare pictures they are of another level. Pixels are beaking soon in this iPhone. Also
Phone is Heating up within 15 minutes.. which is really disappointing.

Storage is not enough though storage part is not their fault. (bought 64gb black varient.)
It’s been about 4 months since I’m using this iphone
Bought it for about 47k INR after exchanging with oppo A57 model for like 1200 INR which is not good. Because that phone was perfectly fine by condition but they.. idk why they reduce it’s cost during pickup. Screen and performance of that phone was good.

It does not include any charger only reverse cable so be sure to buy the charger before buying the phone.
Can’t do anything about storage so guys so buy at-least 128 gb variant because storage is very low and it fills up soo soon..

Also now it costs about 38k on sale so please wait for offers or sale. I’m regretting for buying it earlier it is 9000 rs cheap now. That’s a huge drop i must say…"
334,1,Hated it!,"Not satisfied with camera quality
And display is ok ok. Not a worth product for this price. 👎

But one plus 7 is far better than this. Sound picture quality ,"
335,3,Good,Product is good but to be very honest battery backup is not that good as expected. if battery is not your first priority then you can buy it and carry a power bank which is apple certified. I am getting battery back up of 4-5 hrs as a normal users
336,5,Wonderful,"Amazing phone, I switched from android to apple for the first time. I used to think apple products are just overpriced . But dude, after using this phone for first time it changed my mind.

Camera is superb 5/5
And the best thing about the phone is it’s iOS, it’s 20times better than any android out there.

It’s worth the money, just go for it"
337,5,Highly recommended,"Received the order faster than the date specified. Thanks Flipcart! The delivery person handed with precision, ensuring that an authentic item had been delivered by checking it before leaving, since it was prepaid . The phone is great .
The phone comes without any extra accessories hence the charger, cover and other items had to be ordered separately."
338,5,Excellent,"I got this for 45 k on flipkart sale....only downside is we have to buy charger and earphones separately.... Due to this pandemic period,,some states are doing lockdowns,,it's hard for us to buy genuine charger from iplanet as they are closed......but Best deal I made... I'm satisfied with the product...thank you flipkart for nice packing and fast delivering the product"
339,4,Pretty good,"If u are reading it now then wait for iphone 12 in BBD.
11 is good but OLED over LCD anyday
Don't panic for buying an iPhone just like I did
Use ur money wisely and iphone 12 is a far better option than 11 in terms of display......😉"
340,4,Nice product,"Best i phone 11 in this price range, look owsom, very styles model. Make good impresion to others. Camera clarity is owsom. I have also using iphone 7,so display is i phone 7 great. B'cause i pbone 7, purchased in 50k. So you will see visiable different."
341,5,Worth every penny,"Kudos to flipkart, delivered well in time. Phone itself is fab but donot expect any power adapter or headphones inside like apple 12 series. I didnot know that."
342,5,Wonderful,"Performance is best in class. Camera , that too selfie camera is not so good. Video quality and portrait photos with back camera are outstanding.
Price as all know , bit high. My first iPhone but well satisfied with the product. Charging speed by the in-box dispensed charger is substandard. One should buy a 12W charger or an 18W charger for quick charge. I used Honor 10 before which made me feel this phone heavier. Stability , stored, look and feel are quite good."
343,4,Nice product,"Awesome phone with awesome looks. Value for money but only camera is not that much of worth. Camera quality is just fine compared to android phones. But when we talk any specific brand like APPLE then cnt compare it with any other phones .
Hurrrrah !! Amazing phone for amazing people."
344,5,Classy product,Fabulous phone at low budget 5 hours in pubg while in power saving mode photo are too good photos at night mode is too awesome u can check it
345,5,Fabulous!,Great phone with great performance and no heating issues! Thank You flipkart for delivering of my phone on time! Phone has excellent cameras and purple colour is awesome.I am very happy with my purchase 😊
346,5,Fabulous!,"I Phone 11 is an amazing phone in a great price. I am using IOS for the first time and it’s so good , I am never going back to Android, It’s a win win situation for me. And specially the Black Colour is so sexy. Go for it"
347,5,Worth every penny,"I have been using Iphone 11 for a week, the battery lasts a day easily with average 10hrs of screen ON time. The performance is just superb and I face no heating issues as mentioned in many reviews I saw. The only time my phone heats is when connected to a 18W Apple fast charger which I bought separately. I havent tested the camera yet. Display may be low in specs but it wont be felt to your eyes. Overall a moderately low priced Iphone with Battery Backup and Excellent performance."
348,5,Awesome,The best phone ever iphones no one can match a iphone. There phones are truly intelligent phones thats why they called iphones. The look feel and depth of everything make your soul filled with joy and complete satisfaction. I love my iphone 11 in yellow color unique and amazing. Iphones are beast no phone ever in the history or in the future will match and compete with iphones they have there own competition. ios rocks!! Secure and advance. Battery life omg superb performance like the fast and the furious. Damn I pray🙏🏻🙏🏻 to God that make me able to buy every latest iphone. Pata chalta hai bhai hath mein koi phone hai not like androids the day u buy next day u feel to change your phone that is not in the case of an apple iphone you can stick to your phone as long as you can kabi dhoka nai dega apko😀😀
349,5,Simply awesome,"Feels great to get back to iPhones after a gap of 3 years. Great camera, processor, battery performances. Apple ecosystem adds to the value if you have other Apple products. Display is not on par with Amoled panels, but it's bright and punchier enough. LCD display aids to better battery life I guess. Camera is fabulous, excels in both still photography and video. Overall feels good investing into iPhone again, and am planning to stick to this for at least 3 more years. And guess what.. no other smartphones ages as well as iPhones do."
350,3,Does the job,I bought it with the expectation that the camera would be awesome but it was hopelessly bad. Moreover buying this phone in 2021 is a very bad choice as many good options are available nowadays for this price point. Either go for 12 or some android phone like oneplus. Battery back up is superb but screen quality sucks.
351,4,Pretty good,"Pros - Good Camera In Day Time Not In Night
Speaker Quality Awesome
Inhand Feels Good
Average Display But Touch Rate lower


Cons - 14 Gb Already Used By System 😑
Front Camera Not Good
Battery Discharge After 80 very Fast"
352,5,Super!,Having Apple phone is just a charm and show off. It’s never value for money. Although build quality camera performance is quite good but just to spend to money than it’s ok otherwise it’s not a wise decision
353,4,Worth the money,"Good product ,
But it’s somehow overpriced because :
1- if you compare image from iPhone 11 12 megapixel with Samsung galaxy 64 megapixel, there are only minor differences in the image quality

2- battery backup is good but not better than my old Samsung galaxy

3- performance is good by if you compare it with 8 gb ram you can’t feel the differences

4- same with the display if you compare it with super amoled 90 GHz Samsung or oneplus , the smoothness is quite similar.

So overall a very good product but overpriced for its brand."
354,4,Worth the money,apple is a good product. Camera is good. battery life is ok not good but ok and performance is very high. Display wasn't so good but it's ok and about accessories in the box no charger ok. but i think without earphones device is not completed and speakers sound quality is just a little lower than my galaxy s20 plus. settings vary hard to manage and accounts also very hard to login and use. please make it easy to use not hard.
355,5,Must buy!,"Was scared to purchase this online but it was as it is, working really well and even comes with warranty. Authentic one and looks super sleek and nice"
356,5,Just wow!,"Has some limitations as compared to android but it is stable and is overall a balanced package. I liked it. Thanks to seller, received a genuine product."
357,5,Mind-blowing purchase,Phone looks so premium in hands the purple variant is so solid in colour. Camera performance is good and the mobile performance is excellent. Battery is okay for the average user but a person who uses more needs to charge twice a day daily. Ram management and storage management is good. Display is ips lcd without any refresh rate so that’s could be a cheaper side in terms of display for investing more than 40k on mobile. The phone is overall good and worth the price.
358,4,Nice product,"Overalll a good phone i am a regular android need a chnge so switched over to iphone,not much user friendly but quality wise the best phone u can get.camera looks awesome in daylight night mode quite not gud compared to other phones at this price range.but overall a better phone to buy .the finishing u can never get in android ."
359,3,Nice,Very bad experience with iPhone phone getting heat while charging and touch is not upto the mark and battery backup is also not good . Display is quite good bt touch sampling rate is not good.. so please go with Android one plus or any other in this segment phone .. not a value for money phone. Go with Android which gives good performance Better than iPhone. Waste of money
360,3,Good,Don't know if it's only with my unit or every iPhone 11 is like this... I really didn't enjoy the battery backup.. like I just played cod for barely 1.5 hour and the battery went from 79% to 22%.. otherwise the phone is doing great.

371,4,Delightful,1 week of use I must say this is the best although it could be better if they provided Earpods too as an Android user I didn't have one and have to bought extra. Better buy at offers and sales it would be good for budget.
372,5,Just wow!,"Best Buy... don't think just grab, I also have used 12 pro but that one is not worth the money on the other hand this one sure is worth every cent spent on this one.."
373,5,Great product,"Fast delivery by Flipkart.
As a first time iPhone user following things I noticed
1. Camera quality is just superb in indoor lighting conditions.
2. Very fluid iOS experience
3. Battery life is sufficient for normal user
4. It would take some time to get used to iOS for an android user.
5. Apple don’t supply charger with the phone😡.

Overall satisfied with my purchase."
374,5,Must buy!,"I was using Android from past 15 years and found Android only best for me... 🤪🤪Undoubtedly, Iphone is more safe and has better software.... This phone is excellent ...but this time Flipkart took more higher time to get the same delivered... Iphone 15 ,16 v aan wale aa😂"
375,5,Great product,"Simply I love it !!
Best mixture of hardware and software.'
Pros '
-Smooth and complimenting UI, with iOS 14.4 and widget update
-What frame drop? Be amazed to experience lag-free games and smooth performance across
-camera - perfect night vision camera

Cons '
And it's non
Maybe the screen refresh rate is low, but the iOS experience deceives it"
376,4,Worth the money,"The iPhone 11 - the successor to the iPhone XR - has gone from secondary handset to firmly take the limelight. Offering most of the top-end camera technology of the powerful iPhone 11 Pro, it packs good spec and manages to do so for a lower cost than many would expect - this is the one to go for if you want a good value new iPhone"
377,5,Brilliant,The phone has classy look in hand. Exquisite fit and finish. Have been using iPhones for the last 6 years so that the OS and UI are same with other models. Camera and loud speaker has been improved a lot. Reached the package fast and intact. The phone worth the premium paid.
378,3,Good,"It is good but have some issues like apple i.d.
Social apps like facebook looks like we used in 7-8 years ago in smartphones.Otherwise camera is best.
Overall performance is less than android."
379,3,Nice,I think you can go for iphone 12 if your budget is high otherwise iphone 11 have only ips lcd display which is not better than iphone 12 oled display and camera is best performance is better
380,5,Excellent,My 3rd iPhone 📱 Great performance 👍💪 Amazing visual and sound clarity 👏👏 awesome as always.
381,5,Terrific purchase,Its value for money I must say . I phone is the best what else I can say. Its camera is amazing and low light pictures are way too good. The performance is obviously great but battery takes time to charge with the charger provided . The battery lasts only a day and not more. Overall its a great buy.
382,4,Delightful,"Everything is good in this phone. Not good for gaming, specially high end games like pubg because of battery. Still you can play at least 2hour if full charge on max setting. Charger took near about 2h to full charge from zero. Need to buy 18w charger for fast charging. Best camera phone. Smoothness and frame rates are very good. No lagging.
Over all happy with my purchase."
383,5,Terrific,Flipkart delivered in 24 hrs in a well packaged box. The phone itself is smooth and buttery with class. I am returning to iPhone after 7 years using android and my decision point was peace of mind software support for next 4-5 years. I am so glad I did. Instead of spending 50k+ on an android flagship iPhone is better. Yes not all android apps are available in iOS but user iOS experience blows away. If you there for new flagship phone go for it.
384,5,Fabulous,"Its the best product that person already in apple ecosystem can get.
As always flipkart was true to the word on delivery and the product came within 2 days. package was good and flipkart used otp and secondary confirmation via telephone call for satisfaction that the product was delivered on time.
as for the iphone 11, Screen is 6.1 inch , though resolution is HD but still you cant find the difference. phone is fast and data was easily transferred from one iphone to other by apple NO Difficulty whatsoever.
straightway liked the phone once i unboxed it.
awsm experience."
385,5,Best in the market!,Phone is good. 1st tym on iOS. Enjoying it till now. Things seems to be perfect and easier than android. Will take some time to get accustomed to the iOS.
386,5,Simply awesome,Nice but the price will keep outstanding for everyone to buy it other wise full secured handset Battery backup is awesome processor no words about it if we use with wifi the speed is different compare to one plus 7t
387,4,Worth the money,"Overall the phone is great.
Just the battery performance is little bit lower then iphone xr and other varients and the display is not as good as iphone 11 pro max but yaa the price is also lesser then this so it balances that.
Other then that phone is great, camera is awesome, best for videos too and all other performances."
388,5,Brilliant,Superb original product. Delivered before time by Flipkart. It has a bigger bezels. LCD screen when every one is offering amoled screen at less price. But still performance is superb. Very fast phone. You will enjoy it.

401,5,Highly recommended,Delivery was super fast within 48 hours. Loved the product. You might feel you are overspending for a regular mobile user but at the end of the day its iphone!!!
402,5,Super!,"The best phone, As usual. After iPhone X I have this iPhone 11 (dual camera variant)... swift up gradation for me. battery operating time seems to be enhanced in this model.. camera quality is awesome :)"
403,4,Good choice,"Actually iPhone is amazing but it doesn’t have all features. Generally it has some limitations but it doesn’t have some good features also like dialer is not good, alarm app has no notifications and some errors, browser doesn’t have flexibility some apps have limited functionality. Security is great camara and speed also fantastic but not daily driver"
404,5,Terrific,"Phone works great except the battery,drains quicker when you are playing high graphics game like fortnite etc"
405,5,Excellent,Best camera with best battery I’ve been using since morning but still 70%. Apple really work for the battery this time. Already in love with the product
406,5,Terrific,"The phone is simply phenomenal, I upgraded from my 7 Plus and it was definitely worth it.
The battery life is good, the cameras are great. The phone is a bit big if you’re not used to keeping a big phone. I prefer big phones so I feel comfortable around it.
Having lena guard is a must. Overall it’s a great phone, you shouldn’t upgrade from X or Xs. Not even tiny bit of difference but if you’re on a phone prior to that, go for it."
407,5,Wonderful,"Although I already bought my first ever Apple product last year (iPad 2018), this is my first iPhone ever. And I love it!
I keep seeing people talk about the usual things - the battery, the camera, the display - all that is good but where I think this device knocked it outta the park is it’s performance along with the ease of the iOS 13. Some really zippy work there.
Secondly, I like how this syncs up with my iPad all the time, it’s like they’re good mates.
Apple Arcade - not too many top games in there but the select few that are good take it to another level when gaming on your iPhone. (Someone was pretty high when they brainstormed over this)
Lastly, this is just the prettiest iPhone ever and I dig that!"
408,5,Super!,"Great Phone, I am using mobile phone since 1999, this one is best in all. Very smooth and powerful, Flipkart is best place to buy. Flipkart sells original Apple Phone and with offers. Thanks Flipkart team."
409,5,Excellent,absolutely stunning phone. Switching from android to ios has been an absolute great experience. Best purchase till date. Kudos to apple.
410,5,Perfect product!,"I’ll be rather the billionth person to review it. So, let’s save you all from the misery.

Delivery experience - I ordered this product on 21st Jan 2020 & the product was shipped on 25th late evening. Received on 28th Jan 2020.

Walk into an Imagine store & you’ll get amazing offers there compared to here. Rather Retailers like Reliance Digital might give you additional discounts. On the spot & No Cost EMI too on the card."
411,5,Great product,"Have been used for 2 months its quite good but not satisfied with the camera quality, because of the wide angle lens there is too much lens distortion on the edges i will say 7+ has much more better camera quality with crisp images and with very less lens distortion...."
412,5,Must buy!,just hold it in ur hand and u will be very impressed by its quality. Screen is not full hd but trust me you wont feel it a bit. Very satisfied with purchase.
413,5,Super!,"Man man man!!!!!!!
This phone is just awesome 😍
Let me just tell the Advantages of iPhone 11
•This phone is having 4K video recording. It supports 2160p@24/30/60fps and 1080p@30/60/120/240fps video
• Having HDR
• It is also having IP68 dust/water-resistant.
• Most Important it’s speaker’s it’s just blow your mind awesome👏🏻
• Night Mode is unbeatable although its not you can switch to but it automatically detect when to turn night mode active
•Wireless Charging / Fast-charging Support
CONS
• Big notch.
• Liquid Retina 6.1 inch IPS LCD screen
• No bundled fast charger"
414,5,Just wow!,"Amazing product.
Had waited for sometime to decide if I should go for the XR or the 11. Landed on this later. The device is just so snappy that i feel like my work moves faster. Recommend for anyone who loves the Apple ecosystem and needs performance."
415,4,Pretty good,The fresh new iphone in my hands product red. The display is good just like the X or Xs but the selling point here is the camera and it is really good. The battery is really improved and the new chipset give power packed performance. Not a very smart buy if u already have an iphone X or Xs. But look for all the deals and offers and buy it at the minimum price.
416,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"awesome phone, value for money. nothing is like iphone 11. i just love it. thanks flipkart for safe and quick delivery."

Screen Resolution :
The screen resolution ain’t so great . Even the cheapest of android phones come with a 1080i display but not the damn iPhone 11. Thats a major setback . The pictures in Instagram and FB don’t look appealing enough until you get used to the 720p resolution .

Battery :
Decent Back up . Lasts a day with moderate usage . PubG drains out the battery pretty bad .
This is my first iOS experience . Loving it!"

I bought this device for pubg,to play custom tournaments,and earn money..A13 chip is amazing..no lag in customs matches on mobile network..i play on airtel net.sim network..80-90 ms...

One thing is battery consumption is 15% per match..xr takes 10% per match..so i hope apple fix this..

Sometime during matches it heats a little..then cool down automatic..so heating issue is not a problem..

Touch response is way better than android lcd..

For gaming it is really beast..but if you low on budget,then go for Xr..cause both r almost same)))"

565,5,Excellent,Raw power n performance. Perfect choice considering value for money. Definitely one of the best to get. Loving the experience !!
566,1,Worthless,"New Phone worked for 2 weeks. After it gone dead without any reason and unfortunately lockdown hence at repair center for last 2 weeks. There were a exchange offer for old phone but they deducted amount saying one scratch on edge of old phone, infact any phone if u use for 1 month, if u use ring on ur finger it will come. It was not at all visible. The display, battery, performance for the old phone was perfect, still they deducted. With this experience i suggest you to buy phones from authorised apple sales stores, not from Flipkart. You may found the price is less in flipkart but the model may not be latest. Moreover don't get trap in the exchange offer. They have variouse option to reduce the exchange price while delivery. If you buy from apple store atleast you will get some moral suppprt for these warranty damages but here no support at all. Think twice you make ur decision."

576,5,Wonderful,incredible 🎶 everything just 😍amazing !
577,3,Nice,Overall phone is good but my point is as per feature wise if you compare then it's over priced. Camera is normal. The maximum retail cost on this phone is sixty four thousand nine hundred and flipkart is showing sixty eight thousand three hundred on their website. It's completely misleading information and indirectly cheating with customers. Be aware guys.
578,5,Just wow!,"Switched from 6s and absolutely loving it 😍

586,1,Did not meet expectations,They gave me product with broken seal and box as well. Worst experience. Please don't buy such things from flipkart. They don't accept replacement or even refund. I put replacement after 5 min of receiving the product and i have unboxing vid also but they simple rejected my requests.

590,5,Brilliant,"Great phone, super performance, u will have all features of i phone 11 pro 1 lesser camera and lack of qhd screen doesn’t matter will save your more thn 30k Rs.
Doesn’t makes a difference than i phone 11 pro just 1 camera less could save your money with all i phone 11 pre look. If u want to save more money i strongly recommend for i phone Xr its not so far than 11 just name sake and look.

1 U have wast of money to burn then go for iphone 11 pro
2 U want to save money with complete feel of Rs 1 lack phone then iphone 11 is best* deal for you

3 But... u have limited budget u can save more 20k n u can have all features and performance of iphone with d most selling iphone ever, with “iphone Xr”"

608,5,Awesome,"iPhone 11 is a good phone. Not a very big difference between 12 except for the OLED screen and a very minor camera improvement which is you cant make a difference. If you are planning for a iPhone and you have budget you definitely can go for this without second thoughts.
Now some people are complaining and giving review 0 or so because there is no charger and headphones, but thats been already mentioned so I assume they are illiterate. Its not that Flipkart is removing them duh. Anyways been using it for more than a year."

611,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"Everybody is talking about pros of this phone let me share the negatives.
1. Charging this phone takes lifetime. it took my phone 2 hrs to reach from 21% to 74%.
2. Almost same specs design and built quality as XR
3. Product Red is basically Lipstick Red, totally different from XR.
4. I would rate 0 of 10 in the area of innovation. There is nothing new other than IOS 13 which is full of BUGS.
5. It very heavy around 200 gms and gets heavier if you add cases and covers."

Slightly heavy though but doesn't trouble once you get used to it.
Thanks Flipkart for a fast delivery."
686,5,Really Awesome,"Apple products though quite expensive still keep itself to the mark.
The delivery was completed even before the given date.
Complete satisfaction I would say."
687,2,Slightly disappointed,"Most disappointing aspect is that Apple in the name of conservation of the nature has not only stopped providing adapter with the phone to charge, but also the lightening cable they're giving doesn't fit with other usb adapter or devices merely to create a monopoly so that they can sell the product seperately. Most deservingly they've been slapped with huge penalty by a court in Brazil.

Further, the device has many limitations in features be it camera or other applications compared to other sophisticated Android devices. There's no reason one should go for Apple exclusively. It reminds me of Blackberry. At least I'm not giving up my android device. I'm disappointed."
688,5,Terrific,Very very good excellent thank you for Flipkart

Can anybody tell here how to transfer my android whatsapp chat to iphone?"
695,5,Fabulous!,Thats awesome
696,5,Wonderful,"After heavy usage of 1 day🤗
Camera:- very good, need to improve front cam a little bit found some disturbance while zoom in to a photo
Battery:- not the best but still better than other iPhones i can use it for a full day without any issues (screen time- 5hr 30min)
Display:- no worries with the display u can see the screen without any issues during day time
Performance:- its a absolute gem in this segment, no lags !!
Charging:- doesn’t provide any charger jn the box bought a 20W charger it can charge the phone from 0-100% in 1hr 24 minutes but i faced heating issue only while charging

I hope this will be helpful👍🏿"
697,5,Great product,Love this camera🤞
698,5,Perfect product!,"Received a sealed brand new product from Apple. Got a 20W apple adapter from the store (@Rs. 1900). Initial charging made the phone very hot, but after optimization of various apps there is no issue. Using the phone for last 2 days and so far did not face any problems. Non FHD screen is not an issue which I expected from various junk you tube reviews. People won't notice even, as its a real quality apple retina display. A big thumbs up for the 12 MP cam which is better that all 48/64/108 MP cameras available in various phone. Hence if one is not crazy about 5G and OLED screen of iPhone 12, then iPhone 11 is a phone of choice even in the year 2021. i would like to rate 5 out of 5 stars both for the product and Flipkart."
699,5,Awesome,Very nice phone
700,3,Does the job,"Apple iPhone as usual is a great product. I can rate out of out. The delivery person from Flipkart first time gave bad experience with rude behaviour .. no

749,4,Value-for-money,Everything's fine but 50k for a phone without an earbuds and adapter ? Like what does Apple wants to prove that they're saving money but cutting our pockets ? Phone is premium no doubt but still this shouldn't cost more than 30k

770,5,Terrific,The all rounder phone. This review is written through my iPhone. Only problem is the in box charger as it takes decades to charge the phone 100% buying a 12watt charger is an option or you can even get a 10watt wireless charger Qi type. Rest be assured about the phone.
771,4,Delightful,"Firstly thank you flipkart for such quick delivery in such tough situation of pandemic and then would like mention that first impressions of this device is awesome, beyond expectation, I'll be going review & rating later after using for 1 month"

774,5,Excellent,"One word : BEAST!!
There’s no other phone in the entire smartphone industry which can beat the processor that Apple has put in this device - their very own A13 bionic chip.

Apple company unnecessary created electronic waste by giving slow charger.
Because 70% of people will try to buy a fast charger.

They should have included a fast charger even if they increase in price by some amount."

787,5,Super!,"Just OSM🔥 my 1st iPhone,, and I loved it😍 satisfied 😌"
788,5,Great product,"An awsm phone design is much better then iphone 12 series
I m writing this review after the use of 4month of the iphone11 on normal use battery life is aprox 2days and on continuous use of YouTube and pubg its goes for 6-7 hr i’m a college student and i use mobile 24/7 and its performance is excellent although its an Apple iphone so no need to justify about its performance its best."

790,1,Utterly Disappointed,Its an very shameful thought from apple who does not give and earphone and adapter....they think we are more focused on global warming...but the reality is they are not more attractive towards new user ....its too much expensive when u buy an extra adapter and earphone....so let them know how people were unsatisfied from apple....😡😡
791,4,Pretty good,Well.... i got brand new phone from Flipkart... that was my utmost concern ever since i had ordered this i phone... some negative reviews made some of my past nights sleepless.... although i may be one of those fortunate ones who got new phone... one less star is for late delevery as well as for a bit low battery performance than i expected... rest it is great product so far from Apple...

Pathetic purchase"
833,5,Just wow!,Simply Awesome
834,3,Bad packaging,"Excellent phone by Apple. Amazing battery backup, build quality and phenomenal camera quality.

I only have a complaint about the flipkart packaging. The packaging was pathetic. The phone box was simply sealed inside a flimsy flipkart plastic bag and delivered. Expected at least a better packaging for such fragile items. Also especially since the piece I got was the first batch of iphone delivery in India via prebooking, expected some care at least. Would have given 5 stars for the product. but giving 2 stars less because of packaging."
835,5,Excellent,"Whoever has my kidney, May God Bless You!!!"

839,5,Worth every penny,"You get legit original iphone 11 from Flipkart no scam and iphone 11 is value of money as its still has better processor then any android processors .

Only downgrade thing if you buy iphone is its battery it heats little bit and if you play games it only give you 2-3 hrs battery life then again charge other wise 15-16 hrs day life

Otherwise phone is great"

847,5,Classy product,"Working fine for me so far. My third iPhone after 5S and 7 Plus. Got a good deal on Flipkart and went ahead. I am not a heavy user and use is mainly limited to calls, texting, casual browsing (mainly Medium or reddit or chrome), NetBanking and e-commerce.
Need not say anything about iPhone's user interface and user experience. It's just flawless. Battery performance has been good. How we charge our phone does affect its life so I am careful with the cycles."
848,5,Terrific,Nice
849,4,Value-for-money,"Everything is fine except for the battery backup. Within 40 days the battery life has dropped to 4%. Now it’s 96%. This is really surprising. Even after 2 software updates, it’s dropping really fast. I use this phone as the primary device but do not play any games or hard duty stuff. Still the battery health is dropping drastically!"
850,5,Wonderful,I can't describe the value of this phone. Apple charge what it deserve. Ultimate camera with multiple features and privacy inbuilt is incomparable. Fast charging system make apple perfect. Display and face reader of this phone is great.
851,5,Must buy!,"Being an iOS user since 2014, I have noticed one particular thing about apple products that they never adjust when it comes to delivering quality, iPhone 11 is yet another brilliant example of it, providing power and performance in a single device, the battery has been really upped since its previous counterparts and the dolby sound incorporated in the speakers is just wow!

Camera - Quality is best in market. Capture every detail of an object without losing the quality. Also it can shoot video's upto 4K at 60fps.
Display - 6.1 inch Awesome flawless true tone display.
Build - Glass finish makes the iPhone scratch free. Slippery in hand, must have a good quality case.
Performance- I don't have to to say anything, no other brand phone can match this iPhone's Performance.
Battery- Only flaw i have found that, the performance of battery is not upto the industry standard. Though it runs over the for a regular user (which i m) but it doesn't sport the purpose of a gamer or heavy user."

1005,5,Highly recommended,"Just upgraded from 6s to 11. Yes its been a long time and also a good decision as this phone provides hell lot of a performance. Camera is awesome, battery life is more than 1 day after heavy use, display and touch are too good. Apple could have given 18W charger instead of 5W. Overall its a must buy"
1006,3,Fair,I feel face id recognition is very slow some time even need to key in the passcode. Heating up problem I faced. Display is okay.Over all the price what I have paid accordingly I am not satisfied. Charging takes much time.

Screen Refresh Rate:- 60Htz but it's enough for day to day life, and u must understand that higher the refresh rate, lower the battery backup Touch Sampling Rate:- As per my tests it's almost 200Htz, so it's quite smooth Looks:- Outstanding"

Phone goes heated on daily life uses like whatsapp facebook i shocked about 70 k inr west. When i play BGMI it about blast....??now long 4 to 5 dayes i saw logo off it , relock and put down the phone on table..."
70,2,Bad quality,Heavy weight..over all features not as expected
71,3,Decent product,"Was using the OnePlus 7 pro before this, it was a 2 year old device but still had better battery backup than this Iphone. Rest you all know its an iphone, great camera, nice screen, ios is very smooth and consistent which many android phones lack, Face ID is a pain during Covid and boy they don't give charger which sucks.
Overall a nice phone, battery should have been better"
72,3,Does the job,"I am switching from Android to iOS after almost 8yrs of android phones usage.
Overall I really liked the iPhone 12 due to its seamless high quality display and greater performance.

Pros:
1. Display quality
2. Performance
3. Great features/inbuilt apps from iOS
4. Camera in good light
5. Build quality
6. User friendly interface

Cons:
1. Heats up very fast after few mins of camera use and gaming.
2. Battery drains very fast within few hrs of continuous use for WFH so you need wireless fast charger for sure.
3. Camera and pic quality is good but few flagship mobiles gives even better quality pics
4. Few basic features from android not available and difficult to adjust
5. No adapter provided which is additional 1.8k expense.
6. Basic functionality of Back option not provided at bottom but on top, so you need 2 hands to handle most of the times

I am only giving 3 rating for the seller who have reduced the exchange price of my Old one plus 7 phone just for a small scratch at bottom corner. Old phone was in very good condition with full functioning and no cracks on display as it was only around 1.8 yrs old. Thus I was expecting a full exchange value for it but was disappointed to have 3.3k reduction."
73,3,Decent product,"Spent around 50k, the phone is beautiful in every way but it has some serious flaws as well.. Camera doesn't have pause button can you imagine? While incoming calls you cant get option to reject the calls.. calculator doesn't have history option.. no pro option in camera though video and photo quality is top notch. Found some very unique features and love them but still finding not worth 50k phone.."
74,3,Fair,"Overall good mobile, apart from so called big brand, nothing special in it.
Camera is gud but not wow like Samsung s21+or ultra which I am currently using. Yes performance is really top class. You will not see any lag. Battery could have be better."

85,3,Just okay,Just brand value. Andriod mobiles much lower than this price gives better features. I bought this phone for camera but compared to other mobiles like oneplus 9 and nord iphone does not give better images. No optical zoom.
86,3,Good,"Not sure if FLIPKART would dare to keep this review.
But if it clicks,then good.
I won't review about iPhone12,because its my waste of time. We all are smart enough to watch videos rather than reading reviews here for iPhone.
Review (For your safety):
Make sure you keep all proofs especially video, while opening the box and initial check like dents,scratches etc etc within hour of delivery.

Why its required?
If you share photo or make delay in informing,you will realise that no one in the world is worst than Flipkart.
They always priorities sellers than customers,and it's only because of the frauds happening with them.
As such they have taken every customer for granted.

So be very careful while purchasing every high end items."

91,3,Fair,Very weak battery back up fully charged battery empty in 6 -7 hours normal using
92,3,Fair,Bang for buck at 57K. Bought the product during big billion day sale 2021. Performance is amazing. No lag at all. Camera is excellent during the day. But I expected more in low light shots. Not up to the mark as all the YouTubers say. Battery is average. But over all extremely value for money at 57K
93,3,Just okay,Phone is excellent.. Camera quality is excellent and there is no overheating while charging. Always research about the apple accessories before purchasing and also spend good amount of money in its accessories for long term durability
94,3,Good,When I order this iPhone very excited but realty I will shock to seen camera and pictures quality very poor and when I play BGMI in smooth and extreme the sides will be reach high heating problem I am really disappoint 🙁🙁🙁🙁

105,3,Just okay,Android is better then iOS.
106,3,Decent product,Phone is average performance & battery continues using only 4-5 hours working
107,3,Good,It Emits a Large amount of heat during charging.

It's not worth spending huge amount. Build quality is good.. looks ok.. screen is good.. battery worst..charging speed poor
Usability ok ok.."
109,4,Nice product,"About Flipkart & e kart it’s worst delivery ever during big billion day. About phone after using 10days not great everything is. Average Display, Medium Dolby sound battery back up was half day continuously if we use,overall average impression."
110,3,Decent product,It’s fine not that great
111,3,Does the job,Whenever I am using speaker phone on call there are signal issues
112,3,Nice,Very distrubed with the heating up of device
113,3,Fair,"The phone’s battery is not at all comparable to One Plus. Comparing with 9R. The charging is very slow even with genuine 20w apple charger. And battery drainage is much higher.

FYI, I am a normal user and neither I have not yet installed any game, nor I am a heavy video viewer or something. So, even normal usage won’t give more than 20 hours anyhow… Apple is betraying customer in this aspect!

Rest other aspects are 5*"
114,3,Decent product,"Flipkart delivery and support was decent. product delivered in 5 days.

Genuine Product with Apple care.

Just did normal days to day activities with the phone. Will be updating this review time to time.

Pros:
1) Security and Privacy
2) Smooth UI
3) Camera

Cons:
1) No multi-tasking
2) Overlay of sounds running in background is not present. So you can't listen to music while having a workout guide on your active screen."
115,3,Fair,Product is great but the delivery is to late...if you're into videography there's no other smartphone available to match the video quality and stabilisation iphone12 cameras provide you
116,3,Fair,Not much better..if i buy mi 11x ultra thats better mobile..iphone 12 buy big mistake in my life.
117,3,Decent product,Way backward from flagship Android phones.
118,3,Does the job,Nice mobile and I suggest to buy it
119,3,Decent product,Phone ok good but Flipkart delivery is very poor and also the customer care

121,3,Nice,just ok
122,3,Nice,Heating issues
123,2,Bad quality,"My First and Last iphone.
3 month review.
With android you get phone and a computer.
With iPhone you get just a phone!
I should have gone for S21 Ultra instead.

5 month update.
Battery performance is pathetic.
Even with no games.
I regret this purchase."
124,3,Does the job,So so
125,3,Just okay,Everything is good except battery backup. it drains totally after one day even at normal use. I bought it on diwali sale but I think it is overpriced product if bought on normal days.
126,3,Decent product,Not satisfied with front camera
127,3,Decent product,All good
128,3,Good,"I I purchased this phone on Flipkart big billion sale now it’s been one week I am using this phone I will divide this in pro and con section

141,3,Nice,"Display very good but xs max & 11 pro max using on this phone purchase
Display size small using by gaming but sound good camera average..night mode camera super ..but Portrait model so bed this phone no telephoto lens...
Thanks friends.."
142,3,Does the job,Best iphone ever
143,3,Just okay,Not interested to share.. I phone is just a brand with costlier. The camera quality is good. Only thing is we need to adapt to iPhone. iPhone never adapt for your requirements

145,3,Decent product,Mass phone
146,3,Does the job,"It's being sold only Cz it has an ios.
Except for the software it has nothing.
At this price it has nothing in compare to other brands.
Go for it only if u want to get in ios world otherwise take android for better camera, features, looks and screen too.
Only the software wil be upto mark."
147,3,Does the job,It’s a work in progress product from Apple. Shifted from 6S to 12. Only difference you see is the performance and screen. Battery is still a underperforming component. Display is beautiful and crisp. Not a value for money is an understatement. XR Personified is the name for 12. Cheers!
148,3,Decent product,Nice
149,3,Nice,Not bad
150,3,Decent product,"No fully satisfied at that price point of view
Using 8days usage I upgraded from iPhone 7…
Pros:-camera 4/5
Display 4/5
Performance 4/5
Gaming 5/5
Multitasking 5/5

Cons:-
Main con is battery 3/5
Normal users get one day easily but heavy users it’s get only half day and not user friendly like android!!!"
151,3,Decent product,"I am new Apple Iphone user and I feel it’s “Not a value for money product”. Except for the brand nothing is good as compared to android phones. Android phones are much better at same price with better display, speakers, usability etc.

I like it but not like as a Android phone."
152,3,Good,Overall good phone
153,3,Nice,Selfie camera is not that good how it is hyped
154,3,Nice,"Using the iPhone after using the Android phones, it's like you are downgraded. Android phone have more features and are easy to use compared to iphone. I mean iphone have better camera and operating system but also very costly (very less value for money)."
155,3,Nice,"Performance of the phone is just like iPhone 11, the difference is the size & slight reduction in weight. All other features are nearly the same as of iPhone 11. No new features added prefer to buy iPhone 11, compared with the cost. Also the battery performance of iPhone 11 is much better."
156,3,Good,Value of money ✅✅✅✅
157,3,Fair,Good looking
158,3,Decent product,"Phone is excellent, but camera is not good. If you are using Nokia phone then don’t shift to iPhone, as compere to nokia camera, iPhone camera is very bad.
I have Nokia 7 plus and iPhone 12.

All others things are good in iPhone."

Battery disappointed, having screen time of only 3 hours, battery ia drain at 10-15% every night when phone is idle and with all connectivity swiched off manually.


Other than battery phone is good."
172,3,Just okay,"Gets heated up while streaming Netflix (only for Netflix). Upgraded to iOS 15 but still it heats but not everytime now. Coming from Android very bad battery life. Its good while idle but the moment you start using it, it drains fast. Expected better performance for this price. Noticed minor bugs in app drawer (keypad doesn't come up at times). Expect these bugs in 10k Android phone but not in the overpriced and overrated iPhone."
173,3,Just okay,Battery backup is not that good
174,3,Does the job,Goods phone
175,3,Does the job,"I hope my review isn’t removed by Flipkart because it’s not one with only praise. Well, the device is typically apple.. well built, smooth experience etc. However I personally didn’t find it to be an upgrade from my iPhone X really. People who are upgrading from X or Xs will know what I mean. The screen has a warmer hue, I was told this warmer tone is more accurate than the cooler one on previous models. The in hand feel according to me is far more premium on the iPhone X but it might be due to it’s steel chassis against that of the iPhone 12 which is aluminium. And I found some pre-defined sounds like the lock sound, bedtime reminder, message tone to be considerably lower than that of the iPhone X. Naturally worried, I visited the nearest service centre and I was told not to compare the new phones to the old ones like X, Xs, Xs max etc.. lol. Otherwise the 12 is really good, fast, and more efficient with the A14 chip. Hope this helps."
176,3,Just okay,I feel that I have received refurbished phone many default settings was not as per the criteria as it should be.
177,3,Does the job,"Got my iphone for a great deal on big billion day sale , overall performance is great display quality is good and camera performance also very nice and stereo sound is also good but battery performance is very low for a phone with this price range, Apple is not providing a charger saying environment protection anyways yu will be forced to buy a new charger pricing around 1800 cuz the cable provided is type c to lightning and most of the chargers and previous charges even provided by apple are type A to lightning

234,4,Pretty good,"I bought this iphone 12 in big billion days and saved alot thank you so much Flipkart for this amazing deal. The phone is great and has perfect camera, security and performance is ver good of this phone. No lack at all.
Battery backup is good you can spend a single day without charging it.
Size is perfect as iPhone 11 has same screen size but diffcult to carry but this device is light and perfect in size.
I give 4 star because they don’t other accessories now with iPhone."
235,4,Wonderful,"Bought First Apple product, Awesome design and look.
Happy with the performance but little disappointed with no charger and headphone at this price that's why 4 star given.
Anyways enjoying the one of the finest iPhone available in Market..
Thanks to flipkart for fast delivery."
236,4,Very Good,"Top notch performance, get it if you have budget and want a reliable Smartphone for long term.

Still apple need some improvement in display like high refresh rate, smaller notch or full screen display may be."
237,4,Value-for-money,I want to tell u something before I say anything about this iphone I'm not downgrading this iphone I just wasn't surprised enough after using the phone honestly it made me older.... Camera is the best no need to worry about that...the bionic A14 chip is fast no lags or anything screen is good too...ummm everything is fine but if u want to try something new don't go for iphone...that's my opinion...
238,4,Good choice,"I have been a pixel lover and pixel user for so many years. The only reason for shifting to Apple was the ease of content creation on iOS environment.
Google hasn't been launching new pixel devices in India for almost 3 years now and that is really disappointing. My review is based upon the difference between the 2.

Apple lovers may not like my review but even though there is a lot of difference between google and apple, I've still rated the phone as a 4 star product.

I will start with...

***** Camera *****

Still photography is still much better on a pixel device. In fact, the pixel 4a clicks better stills than iPhone 12 (as per my experience). However, pixels video quality has been really disappointing. Specially with front camera. This is where iPhone beats pixel. You are not just going to click stills but also would like to take good quality videos. Content creation is all about cameras that are good in doing the both. Hence, I would say iPhone beats pixel because of the video quality and a good (not the best) still photography.


***** Battery Backup *****

Amazing!! Just amazing! Again, this is based on the comparison between iOS and Android. I've heard that battery backup on iPhone 12 is not that good but someone who is coming from and Android environment will notice a considerable difference. You can opt for iPhone 11 if battery is a major issue for you.


***** Siri vs. Google Assistant *****

Siri is no where around GA. There's a legitimate reason for this. Google has been collecting data for so many years. Hence, the GA is smart enough to respond to and act accordingly. Context switching is what I miss when I use iPhone 12. But that's Google vs Apple and not something that is related to iPhone 12. So chill!!

***** Look & Feel *****

5 stars! Hands down!


I bought it for 48k during BBD sale. To be honest, that should be the true price of this phone. IT IS NOT WORTH 80K!!"
239,4,Worth the money,"Such a great phone with great features…excellent camera and display….decent battery life .. value for money phone …beast like processor ❤️❤️❤️
You can go for this without any hesitation … if u want to use a phone for long term simply go for this (128 gb) …"
240,4,Pretty good,"As switched from an android to ios it's worth upgrading .However ,there are some things particularly in iOS which i dislike for instance,it's a big challenge to transfer your data to a laptop unless it's a MacBook. Overall i can say the camera quality is top notch and processor which we all know it's the fastest chip yet furthermore the security we get is far better than android devices moreover thanks to flipkart for delivering the product earlier than the scheduled date."
241,4,Pretty good,"Delivery is super fast, after using it for 2 weeks, camera quality is superb, very smooth UI, compact and very light weight. 1st week everything was good, but after that auto rotate feature stopped working and eSim calls disconnecting frequently, contacted apple support but issues not yet resolved."
242,4,Pretty good,"Definitely an awesome product...an awesome experience if you are upgrading from android.... Bgmi experience is unmatched...
The performance and day to day activities on the mobile is way different than any other can offer....
My suggestion is ..if you can afford it....you may go if you are a lover of quality over quantity..
Battery is okay...neither like it cant even run few hours nor like it will run till days...in between...you can take it with a little over mild usage....for 6 to 7 hours...
For spectators......not much of a difference between 11 and 12....


It was my dream....and after a lot of reasons not to buy... I went for it...
Have to pay 10k a month for the next 6 month....😅😅
But still...looking and using it daily....will give me a reason to work hard and earn everyday....

PS- purple, red and blue is better if u want people not to misunderstand it with 11....
But this color is just love 💕"
243,4,Good quality product,"Well I bought this at 67k..using Amex discount! Lucky enough for that. Thanks FK & Amex
Mow coming to the device and specifically to its camera, its over hyped according to me!
I have watched a lot of reviews and all those sweet things about camera and pic quality but there are some caveats.
1. Picture gets pixelated when you try to zoom in even after 30 to 40% of actual image
2. Though the device houses the fastest chip across the globe (at the time of release), it still take couple of seconds to process the image
3. Ultra wide is just average

Well, since the aperture of camera is good, night shot does come great!!

My primary reason of buying this phone was for camera but m not very satisfied."
244,4,Delightful,"Undoubtedly awesome in performance, after all it’s 🍎, didn’t like battary backup though, with heavy usage can’t survive for a day, need to juice up in evening, another disadvantage is No fast charging.. Camera is good but not best out there and also keep in mind there is no file manager for data management and data sharing is not as easy as android."
245,4,Nice product,Providing review after 1 month of use .. no doubt it’s a good mobile handling is very smooth n performance is very good as well front camera is descent back camera is awesome with a nice detailing… cons battery life is not very long proper use of phone may need charging once in every 10 hours … if you lay down and try to open the phone by face recognition then it doesn’t work .. you need to hold the phone flat parallel to your bed then it opens up.
246,4,Worth the money,Best mobile ever reasonable deal and zest money best
247,4,Worth the money,Battery is typically like a 4000mah device uses with two sims. ( assuming u use iphone 12 with one sim with location wifi etc off). For office type use its no issue. Field work types people will want more battery for sure. Cameras are good. Apps aren’t bulletproof as they claim. Ola app has bugs. Doesn’t hang. But its still not as fast fluid as one plus. Its not slow mind it. But the buttery transitions on ios make it relatively slow. Speakers have bass sorta.
248,4,Very Good,I am first time use iphone very fast performance battery backup to good iphone unic features copy paste double tap screen shot extra very help ful camera low light very good but camera manual mode missing no hug but some time get bugs crome browser totally 9/10 thanks to apple 🍏
249,4,Nice product,"Front Camera at low light doesn't give a good result at all. Looks Cheapest Camera ever.
But in light it does work good and about other things its just Apple.
A Perfect Masterpiece.
Very light Weight device with Quality Look."
250,4,Good choice,"It is really a nice product by apple but there are some disappointments too. First the battery is small, and that’s why the phone is very light (this is the advantage), If you are updating from iphone 6 or 7 you will not mind but if u are updating from phone 11 then you would definitely find a difference. Second thing the display is not that bright. I compared it with iPhone 11 and 7 plus and saw that 11 and 7 plus both were more bright. Third when we use the camera for like more than 5-10 min the phone starts to heat up, but once we stop using camera the phone cooled down immediately which means it does not affects the battery so no issue. Else the phone is perfect, but I think iPhone 11 is better than iPhone 12. It is just that it is a newer product so people are cutting it. The camera quality of iPhone 12 is lot better than iPhone 11 so if camera is not your priority then you can but iPhone 11 too."
251,4,Worth the money,"Camera pe perfect.
Screen is good but smaller then the other smart phone which are half on price.
Price was good on big billion day but not on diwali sale.
Don’t understand the point of buying the charger saprately."
252,4,Value-for-money,"Overall a good phone but camera is not as it was hyped. May be software update can change the camera quality. Specifically, the portrait edge detection is not at all good. Other than that the build and finish is excellent. Display is very good. The phone is responsive. Overall a very good phone but not a phone to be priced above 60 - 65K for 128 GB."
253,4,Delightful,"1. Battery drains very fast.
2. Photo quality superb.
3. Cannot migrate from android to ios. Move to ios app is not effective and good.
4. Android is far better in handling.
5. Power adapter was not provided. Got it after 01 month from flipkart (separately purchased). Till now charging with my Samsung A50.
6. Overall not satisfied at all."
254,4,Good quality product,"Awesome camera, awesome battery life and amazing speed. The size is perfect for someone looking for a phone that fits comfortably in the pocket and in the hand. Suitable for one handed use.

255,4,Nice product,"If u want to buy phone to not much work it worth.
If u want to multitask go with Android.
It video quality is awesome specially 4k 60fps.
Very nice phone."
256,4,Delightful,"Everything is fine can live without a higher refresh display but the battery life is not satisfactory.batter life could be better to make it a perfect flagship, moderate to heavy users need to charge it twice. Overall a good product."
257,4,Worth the money,"Much hyped... Good for a BBD purchase 51k, usable for a normal user.. Got it for my wife, she loved it.. Personally, Android flagship model user, love the SD 888 performance... Can vouch for the iOS, nothing superior if you have proper hardware.. hope apple support will be strong... Go for it if you love the brand gimik..."
258,4,Value-for-money,"Ok here’s the thing. The only thing apart from the charger that will probably make you think twice ‘why apple, you could have at least added this’ is the Apple earphones. At least a wired one. That’s not much of an impact but at one moment it will for sure hit you. Otherwise it’s an amazing phone. The best so far."
259,4,Very Good,"Seriously I didn’t the camera quality better, I was using 6 and now moved to 12 but 6 camera quality is good in terms of worth of the product however overall product is really nice"
260,4,Nice product,"Got it for 53K. Upgraded from Oneplus 7. Good software. Very smooth and lag free. No heating issue while using. Video clarity is really great. Battery is good for one day of heavy usage. I used to end up my busy schedule at 6pm with around 30% battery

Compared to Oneplus 7 still camera is lack of colours. I felt like all photos washed out of colours. Front camera is really bad. Display also lack of good punch in terms of colours. My Oneplus life was really colourful in-terms of camera and display"

BUT, the game crashed a couple of times recently in my iPhone 12 and before crashing it got stuck also which is a matter of concern & raises the eye in suspicion. I got this deal cheap in the BB days, but if you are going to buy it on its original price, it is not worth it."

328,4,Worth the money,"Needless to say anything about the iPhone. It sure comes with a price range but if you have invested so much of money then there is no point of giving any negative feedback for obvious reasons.

Though just wanted to point out the delivery segment that flipkart delivers. The delivery guys are the worst. Its good that they are providing us by delivering the products but the management system is what i want to talk about. Since the high price range mobiles comes with Open Box delivery, but the delivery guy from Ekart refused for as such information and denied of taking the responsibilities saying that I haven’t opted for Open box delivery. I do not want to point out the delivery person’s name and I am sure in many oarts if the country people faces the same issues.

My heart full request to flipkart is to educate the delivery persons and come to their notice regarding the Open box delivery system for eligible products and also that it comes by default and there is no option to deny OBD."
329,4,Worth the money,After using 10 days I found apple iphones are premium phone lookwise and from every angle.i shifted from Android to this phone and first time buyer of apple iphone.i experience Android phones are more user friendly rather than iphones.

374,4,Nice product,Very good phone
375,4,Nice product,Vry loved
376,4,Worth the money,"Phone is beautifully designed and superb performance. I haven’t expected that long battery life. In a typical day you can get upto 1day of usage for sure.

Also this is my 1st transformation from android to iphone. So for sure you will get bored because you dont have that compatibility freeness to use as android.

But if your are new to iphone or switching from older to newer iphone. I highly suggest to go for it rather iphone 13. Since their is not much difference. This is my review after usage of 1month.

Why am I not mentioning about camera, performance and all is since it is an iphone. For sure you will get the best from apple products as this also gives me best. Also for 4star only because of getting bored quickly within a month. Other than that phone was super in all everything as performance, camera is my major priority.

I have really really liked it, just anyone looking to buy iphone 13 or 12 pro. I highly recommend you to go for 12 only.

Thank you"
377,4,Wonderful,Awesome

383,4,Very Good,Liked it!
384,4,Worth the money,"Good choice!!
Got from NVIGR retails, authentic product faster delivery. Phone is good, I moved from 6s to 12 so at first, felt bulky but with time perhaps one would get used to it. Price wise it’s ok for 54k. So overall it’s good, yet to check the battery sustainability, though I guess it can do around 7-9 hours screen on time. Form factor is seemingly handy given the fact that bigger phones are trend, however if someone wants the slick convenience of single handed usage then 12/13 mini are better options , though there are a few caveats while choosing mini options - 1) 12 mini battery around 6 hrs screen on time , which is quite less , 2) 13 mini holds same screen on time as compared to 12 however it’s price is higher side; if budget is not your concern and you want handy phone then 13 mini can be a go-to choice. 3) In case you want to spend time on bigger screens like playing games watching video, browsing, basically if entertainment is all also a part of your usage, then mini won’t render you with the desired experience. With Apple, I believe, buying a year post the release of the device can save a considerable amount of money over buying on release date, hence 12 is apparently a right choice right now. Few tips while ordering and taking delivery - 1) when ordering , make sure to check Flipkart assured icon and check the seller rating 2) while taking delivery - ask the agent to open the box for you while you make a video of unboxing 3) the IMIE number on the box should match with number on the bill. 4) Apple has introduced a QR code seal tab on the packing of the phone, make sure the seal is there and intact. Post delivery , you can check the imie number in general setting of the iPhone and match it with the bill. In iPhone setting, You can also check the warranty tab and check the time stamp that is one year from the date of your iPhone purchase, this will assure the coverage of Apple company warranty. Also, you can check online, with the serial number of the device entered on apple office website can also help you check the authenticity of the product. With all these check you can assure the legitimacy of the phone.
Given 4 out of 5 basis my expectations from Apple; in-display finger print, a little more handy device along with a better battery would have garnered 5/5 here. Overall it’s a good phone, Flipkart is genuine, NVIGR seller is authentic , product is genuine.
Hope this review helps.
Thanks"

Now coming to the phone itself, anytime a btr phone over 11 in every aspect, be it screen, network reception, 5g, battery backup, design, low light camers…
Not giving 5 stars just for the weak battery. It gives backup equivalent to any android phone of 4000mah in 2021 i.e. 5.5 to 6 hours of screen on time. And ppl who are spoilt by samsung will understand that we expect atleast 7 hours of SOT, and yeah that has been solved now in 13."

Things I didnt appreciate was paid call recording feature whereas in android its free, 20W charger should have been included. In android directly we can type the initial numbers/alphabets and retrieve the contacts, but the same is missing in iphone.

Overall value for money I would say. The custom duty should have been lower though.

Go for it, you will not regret"

Few honest things I want to make you guys note

Cam

Primary cam is superb no doubts, beautiful night shots.
Secondary cam could have been better. Sharpness lacks. Needs improvement


Battery and processor

A14 bionic chip, nothing more to say on that. Blazing fast speed.
Battery 2850 mah. You guys might think it's not enough.
Not enough but the A14 bionic chip makes the battery last easily for a day or 1.5day

Screen
Oled screen a big pro
Not LCD like previous gen iphones.

559,4,Value-for-money,Apple I phone 12 is the best ever model launched by Apple. The biggest drawback is that the price dropped terribly. The company should atleast retain prices for a year or two. Rest everything is fine.

I bought this under the bigbillion sale 128gb for 55000 and that is a price I feel is justified.
The switch from.my 7plus there's ton that's changed though low light photography could have been better and the camera has only 5x optical zoom that's a bummer.
Charging speed improves significantly with the 20w adapter."

My first iPhone 😑,previously one plus 8T. The main selling point of the iPhone every year is camera, I cannot say wow for the camera it performs equally with android phone, I bought it in big billion days for “48,999” it’s worth the money. But disappointed with camera performance, I thought it would over perform android phone.

Software and performance of the phone are really good as expected

They should have maintained iPhone 11 battery with this, over all for minimal usage it’s good, if you are doing any intensive work like video and game it won’t last more like android."

702,4,Nice product,Super fluid ui. You will definitely feel some difference when switch from android to ios. Phone optimisation is super never seen in any flagship android phone.

Pros:
Great display (compared to any android in practical condition)
Buttery smooth
Great camera( only back not front)
In hand feel

Cons-
Few basic functions missing ( call recording option)
Less customization as compared to android
Front camera poor performance
Even though i bought it at 55k but still think paid more then what this device deserves. ( but can't help as it's apple)"
713,4,Good choice,Awesome
714,4,Delightful,Overall good purchase
715,4,Nice product,Overalls ok..!!
716,4,Delightful,"Camera is good, display is good, but talking of battery it feels like using a phone of 2016."
717,4,Value-for-money,"Pros:
Good display but if you compare with samsung flagship its not that great
Main camera is great on par with samsung but no pro mode in it
Selfie excellent
Video excellent
Battery life good
Build quality excellent but if you tap on screen it sounds like plastic due to ceramic coating

Cons:
Speakers are good and gives wide range but i feel that treble might be better in terms of clarity loudness is great
Major thing is it has ip 68 rating and apple claims we can go further than rated we used in swimming pool phone is working good but water get into speakers and ear piece and then we used water ejector app like the frequency some water came out but some where there for whole day, this will really threatening and here after we afraid to get it into swimmg pool earlier i used samsung s7 in that by just shaking it all the water in speakers will get pulled off but not in this phone."

729,4,Value-for-money,Good
730,4,Really Nice,Apple is one of its kind experience. And getting the apple iphone 12 at such a competitive price makes its a no brainer choice! Highly recommended though the cameras are not of the grades of the pros but they do their job well.
731,4,Good quality product,"There was too much hue and cry for battery life but I found it very decent, was able to continue the full day with a single charge.
Face recognition could have been better, at times it unlocks the phone even i am far and not properly facing the camera, and at times it doesn't work in one shot even I am facing the camera.
And if you have a slight might mask even at your chin it won't work at all.


The processor is blazing fast, able to open the apps before the blink of an eye and the speakers are really good.
Also, no heating issues, although it got a bit hot at times it is connected to the charger.

One big downside which I feel with iPhone is the extra money you need to spend on accessories like chargers, earphones, connectors, etc, it really creates a big dent in your pocket even if you go with the non-branded and also the battery health which will keep on diminishing with the time, there is more than 90% chance that you wont be able to use your iPhone for more than 3 years with the same battery,"
732,4,Value-for-money,Simply beast🥵
733,4,Wonderful,This iPhone is really great. I love it. Got this at 55k
734,4,Good choice,AMAZING PHONE
735,4,Really Nice,Awesome 🔥
736,4,Pretty good,"Overall awesome product...

1. My first ios experience the reason i given 4 stars is camera everyone says iphone camera is just lit but its not that good...

2. Camera is somewhat okay not better than vivo v17 pro or other flagships of the same price (in comparison)...

3. Rest the product is good in other expects like looks, performance,battery and display is little yellowish idk why.

4. I ordered it from big billion days on 3rd October and the parcel reached on 6th of October at a cost of 49999 rs.

5. They refused to provide open delivery but never mind wanna take this phone at any conditions (was a real product at last no fraud done)🤧

In bonus

******Just a suggestion please record a video while opening the box for security reasons 😂******"

5. Performance lit as f
6. And in-hand feel hahaha it's a showoff material

754,4,Delightful,"If you are used to big display then this phone gonna disappoint you camera is good it can take god pictures in low light. In performance department it is goona outperform all the android smartphone just amazing how Apple manage to put this level of performance in 2020 even though it is a generation behind from latest from Apple but it is a generation ahead from android smartphone in terms of performance display is good no complains but Samsung s21+ has better display , battery life is decent not the extraordinary easily last whole day on normal use on single charge , software is smooth very well optimised and limited same time it can irritate you because not that easy to use like android after using almost 1 week i can safely say if u want a decent display good performance small phone factor and want to keep phone at least 3 to 4 years go for it but if u want a big ,better display and easy software go for s21+ it will make more sense don't fall for that Apple brand"
